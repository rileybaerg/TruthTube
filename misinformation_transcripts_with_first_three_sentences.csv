2HBskksF0vQ,"all right, when might you want to be eating sticks of butter? well, I think, outside of maybe early transition periods to ketogenic diets or carnivore diets- uh, that largely is going to be kind of productive now in the beginning. you know, when you're having struggles switching over from more carbohydrate-based diet to more fat based diet, you're not very efficient at using some of these different ratios."

LCUTcCt4Tlc,"a lot of people find that it's really hard to over consume steak or meat- you know, ground beef it's hard to do that- where it's quite easy to over consume Donuts, or you might even say honey or something like that, because that sweetness drives more of the feeding behavior. and I think you know you are right: humans, just at the basic levels, want to consume as much energy as we possibly can get in because we don't know if we're going to eat again, whereas the reality of the modern day life is, yes, you're going to be able to eat tomorrow.

zBSfAQaNFhY,"okay, here's a couple weird side effects from the carnivore diet that some people have reported. I've seen some of them myself. so number one is the lack of hiccups."
wyALe27tc04,"a little interesting fact. so over the last 20, 30 years, calorie consumption in the United States has not really gone up appreciably, but the Obesity rates certainly have. our microbiome actually consumes some of our calories and some studies up to 22 percent of the food we consume is actually eaten by bugs that inhabit our gastrointestinal tract."
9A0dO_KRo3E,"okay, after doing the last video on the macronutrients, there's a lot of people asking: what are you doing to get those macronutrient erasers? so you know, currently, like I said, about 300 grams of protein and around 200 grams of fat, roughly. it's not exact, but it's pretty close to that."
pRNTmVO3ygQ,"all right, let's talk a little bit about, uh, the macronutrients I'm consuming. while I'm leaning out, so normally at sort of Maintenance, I'm usually sitting, you know, roughly 300 grams of protein, 300 grams of fat, that is, you know, something like 3 900 calories, and it is about 69 for those calories come from fat. currently, I'm eating 300 grams of protein and 200 grams of fat."
8HvEXbTvdx0,"hey folks, as I am currently been leaning up, some people ask me kind of what I'm eating, what my macronutrient breakdown looks like. so, just for review: got up to around close to 270 uh on Carnivore. I'm now coming back down."
nxoFpFKAbYM,"we'll get. another common misconception around a carnivore diet is you will become constipated. now what is true is most likely, if you regret dramatically reduced your fiber intake, you go to the bathroom less frequently and your bowel moves will be smaller."
uLEFrKA7oCo,"okay, here's another mistake I see people on a carnivore diet often doing- and this is a very common mistake- and one is people do this for the reason of losing weight, which is, you know, Common, because there's a lot of people that are struggling, unfortunately, with too much obesity. um, and one of the things I see people doing is they just restrict them in a number of calories they consume and they end up lots of craving and binging and unable to stay in the diet. so don't try to immediately go on a caramel diet in a massive restrict how many calories you consume, because it's going to come back to bite you in the form of not being able to sustain a diet."
ZdgFUH-o4AI,"okay, here's one mistake that I see people on a carnivore diet doing quite quite commonly. one is is trying to quit coughing when you first transition to a carnivore diet. now, certainly, reducing or quitting coffee can be beneficial for many people."
6sNH0kTlwhQ,okay. so the question on the other side of the scale: but what about protein? what's protein you need?
iIk4qkYmZ6g,"okay, if you watch the last video, the obvious questions. well, who are the groups that might benefit from an even higher fat diet? well, certainly, uh, what I've seen is people healing certain neurologic conditions tend to skew towards higher fat percentages, at least for a time."
jvMw4aoiK1E,"okay, people are asking to ask me: you know about macronutrient Racers on a carnivore diet. well, I mean, for most people you're going to consume, probably between 60 and 80 of your calories, by percentage, are going to come from fat, leaving the rest from largely protein. there might be some Trace carbohydrates in there if you eat things like eggs, a little bit of dairy, but pretty much, you know, 60 to 80 fat."
9kaoG78e9M4,"all right, a follow-up question on the dog feeding video. and there's one of them, there's Maximus and there's Sasha. anyway, Sasha's about 45 pounds, Max was about 18 pounds."
ljsAwdzkZos,"did you ask me what I feed my dog goes and see if you can see him in front of me. anyway, the big one is a white Golden Retriever named sausage, about 45 pounds, and a little one is Maximus. he is a about an 18 pound what's called a cottone de tullier, and they basically just eat meat, and so I give them a lot of typically leaner ground beef, sometimes ground turkey, sometimes bits of chicken."
H6e_pvCuj-g,"okay, let's talk a little bit about all-cause mortality in the uh relationship between ileo cholesterol and likely apob. I think there's more studies on LDL suggestions. I don't know if there's much on apob, but certainly you know, when we, when we distinguish between cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular mortality, it all cause mortality."
VUpFewydSwg,"so if we have people that are metabolically healthy is defined by the last video- are they likely to have heart disease when their apob levels or LDL levels are high? well, it's interesting. there are some, a number of cities out there, that suggest that perhaps not, not, not, not conclusively not, but perhaps not."
6wJv9qigcMA,"okay, further discussion on LDL or, for that matter, APO B. now, for most people, a rise in LDL cholesterol or high level of apob is associated with cardiovascular diseases. there's pretty clear evidence that certainly shows that. but again, remember, most of that evidence is gained from standard population uh metrics where the average person is eating you know kind of a standard American diet, high carb diet, so on and so forth."
BOFHJY89xV4,"uh, what if I go on a low carb, ketogenic or carnivore diet and my LDL cholesterol goes up? well, first of all, first thing I'll tell you is you should not ignore that just because you're on a low carb diet doesn't mean that it's automatically something we can disregard. however, there is some Nuance to that and so, uh, you know, the same thing with April would be April B, and LDL cholesterol more or less basically track in the same direction."
32JoLDt78yQ,"all right, folks, I'm getting ready to head out to Jujitsu. there's a couple- just a couple- uh tips I think are helpful in the context of carnivore diet for athletic performance. one is stay on top of your hydration."
A9Rdr3p863I,"all right, high fat, low fat, moderate fat- what's the best thing for carnivore? well, the truth be told is it depends. uh, you know."
C65hjhVe6O8,"all right, let's talk a little bit about gut issues on Carnivore diet. the most common reason I see people still continue to have gut issues on a carnivore diet are primarily uh fat consumption, and it's usually excessive fat consumption relative to what you can safely or naturally absorb, and so that often comes more often in the context of rendered fat. rendered fats would be things like grease, bacon grease, hamburger grease, concentrated fats like Butters and creams."
n7IDgTx3ym4,"okay, a lot of people consult me with regards to trying to get really lean on a carnivore diet and one of the concepts that I have utilized, the so-called concept of fat cycling. that is where you focus on three or four days of relatively leaner cuts of meat and then on the fourth or fifth day you add in the fat ear cuts of meat. you just repeat that over and over again and that usually is pretty effective for most people, I've found."
lWF60znL3fk,"a lot of people ask me about how much do I need to eat on a carnivore diet. well, I think, if you're starting out, the first thing you need to do- most people, you know, have some sort of bad eating habits. the first thing is: eat enough so you don't want the garbage."
GQskSm1OpXU,"so I am a Bitcoin hodler, just just for for reference, and the guys that got me, you know, same thing who wrote a Bitcoin standard and a guy named Mike Goldstein, and they are both carnivores and they've been doing it for longer than I. I think that you know. obviously, when we talk about a lot of people in crypto, I know the Bitcoin guys will be mad to say: Bitcoin is crypto, it's different. right, that's, that's the the thing."
zGvTzQYALV8,"okay, final tip on Cravings. you know, let's say, uh, you know the the. unfortunately, none of these uh techniques work that we talked about in previous videos."
2SAKQTbzCCY,"all right, Cravings. let's talk a little bit about those. uh, first of all, um, you know, there, there's a strategy for this that I think works quite well, and I call it prevention, distraction, and then replacement, and, and so, uh, many people aren't going on a carnivore diet."
r2iiAm4TDgQ,"okay, let's talk about the role of distraction when it comes to Cravings. well, we know that most Cravings, or many Cravings, are dependent upon certain hormones- the one in particular is gorillin- and it tends to be time limited. so over a period of time- maybe 30, 45 minute- that craving will pass, and so if you can distract yourself for that period of time, it can be very effective."
9z2bytr0Zyc,"will do a high protein diet or a carnivore diet and they'll notice sometimes that they're serum creatinine number is elevated now in in many cases, an elevated serum creatinine could indicate that there's a problem with your kidneys. however, there are many cases where that's an expected finding and it's not related to- uh, kidney issues. and one is: you are having, you have a lot of muscle mass."
KJESZPTBgZI,"all right. this is a common question that comes up quite often and it is about whether or not you must consume organ Meats to successfully do a carnivore diet. well, the answer that is generally no."
BbId6ZrM218,"oh, somebody's asking me for a little tip for cooking steak. so one thing that I think is an important thing to do is, prior to searing a steak, always dry it off real well. you don't want a lot of surface moisture on this take because what happens is that moisture has to be cooked off and it takes longer to cook the steak, longer to sear the steak."
CTZKaU7urUU,"hey, guys, I wanted to share an observation with you that I've seen over the years, and one thing I've seen is that Winners tend not to be whiners and whiners tend not to win. so the lesson there is when faced with adversity, you know, whining about it, complaining about it, is not the answer, right, the answer is: figure out what you can do to overcome that and and let it inspire you- in fact, I like losing at time because it inspires me to get back after it and to grind and to be able to overcome these obstacles. and the more you, the more you do that, the more you have that mindset, the more successful you're going to be over time."
Est2D8oIr54,"Josh and I've been doing this a while and I literally spent every single day of my life talking to people about this stuff and I mean it's almost what happened. I seen.

HWmnkOcllMA,"okay, a lot of people ask me about: should you eat fish on a carnivore diet? Well, you certainly can, and if you're going to eat fish again, if you're on a carnivore diet, you're not taking any carbohydrates in, or very little uh, so you need fat, you know. so fattier cuts of fish, so things like salmon, mackerel, sardines, those are all great, uh options for people."
Y-CwTfiDnVs,"account you should think about as a metabolic disease. you know it has a component of metabolic syndrome and often has a component of immunological compromise, and so whether or not you eat meat or something else is not really the main considered Factor here. now, certainly, things like fructose, alcohol and pure enriched foods can exacerbite gout, for sure."

ycvoDkaKc9s,"okay, does the carnivore diet help prevent cancer? well, the the answer to that is: we have no idea. there's no way to really know that, but what I can tell you is that a carnivore diet often helps people lose weight, uh, so they remove obesity from the equation, very often decreases inflammation and very often improves glycemic control and very often- uh you know- helps people with better nutrition."
YYcWJq2HvQw,"all right. what food should you absolutely avoid? so the combination of refined grains, sugar and Industrial oils."
BZNNQe0SeW8,"all right, let's talk about the top four reasons to eat a carnivore diet. well, number one: it rids us of all Ultra processed foods. Ultra processed foods are clearly the cause of most of the diseases that we see, particularly chronic diseases."

jzhj-djklnQ,"so I just started reading about all these people doing this crazy, you know I'll meet that- and I look back and look back in the days of like, uh, you know, some of the old, old-time bodybuilders- steak and eggs diets, Vince guaran and those types of guys.

IxF1iwSyLXU,"problem is researchers say, well, that's, that's the best we can do, because we can't do an ethical study, we can't do a, you know, 20, 30 year study just feeding people this and randomizing them. you know, it's just, it's just technically, you know, impractical to do and it costs too much money. so they're saying like, well, that's the best we have."
5otfTXdOSjA,"if I was to take all the food in the world and I was going to draw a line in terms of food that would potentially bring down knee pain versus food that would, uh, inflame or activate more knee pain, where do you draw that line? is it just as simple as meeting and everything else, or is there? well, I mean, you certainly can draw the line there and, as you probably know, I I'm an advocate of a meat-based diet."
-1xnSr-Qcdk,"why did a change in diet have an impact on the knee right and pain and kind of all these aspects?
