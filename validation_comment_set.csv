Health Benefits of Turmeric,Dr. Eric Berg DC,"Turmeric, also known as turmeric or turmeric root, is a spice widely recognized for its potential health benefits. Here&#39;s a summary of its main benefits:<br><br>Anti-inflammatory properties: Curcumin, the main active compound in turmeric, has strong anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce inflammation in the body and alleviate inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases.<br><br>Antioxidant: Turmeric is rich in antioxidants, which help neutralize free radicals and protect cells against oxidative damage, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases and premature aging.<br><br>Brain health improvement: Studies suggest that curcumin may have neuroprotective effects and potentially reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s, as well as improving mood and cognitive function.<br><br>Promotion of heart health: Turmeric may help reduce risk factors associated with heart disease, such as high blood pressure, oxidized LDL cholesterol, and inflammation, which may contribute to cardiovascular health.<br><br>Support for digestive health: Turmeric may promote digestive health by stimulating bile production by the liver and aiding in the digestion of fats. Additionally, its anti-inflammatory properties may help relieve symptoms of digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.<br><br>Potential anticancer effects: Some studies suggest that curcumin may have anticancer effects by inhibiting the growth and spread of cancer cells and helping prevent the development of certain types of cancer.<br><br>While turmeric offers a range of health benefits, it&#39;s important to note that more research is needed to confirm and fully understand its effects. However, incorporating turmeric into your diet as a spice or supplement may be a simple way to potentially improve your overall health.",Misinformation,,"['turmeric', 'also', 'known', 'turmeric', 'turmeric', 'root', 'spice', 'widely', 'recognized', 'potential', 'health', 'benefits', 'here39s', 'summary', 'main', 'benefits', 'br', 'brantiinflammatory', 'properties', 'curcumin', 'main', 'active', 'compound', 'turmeric', 'strong', 'antiinflammatory', 'properties', 'may', 'help', 'reduce', 'inflammation', 'body', 'alleviate', 'inflammatory', 'conditions', 'arthritis', 'inflammatory', 'bowel', 'diseases', 'br', 'brantioxidant', 'turmeric', 'rich', 'antioxidants', 'help', 'neutralize', 'free', 'radicals', 'protect', 'cells', 'oxidative', 'damage', 'potentially', 'reducing', 'risk', 'chronic', 'diseases', 'premature', 'aging', 'br', 'brbrain', 'health', 'improvement', 'studies', 'suggest', 'curcumin', 'may', 'neuroprotective', 'effects', 'potentially', 'reduce', 'risk', 'neurodegenerative', 'diseases', 'alzheimer39s', 'parkinson39s', 'well', 'improving', 'mood', 'cognitive', 'function', 'br', 'brpromotion', 'heart', 'health', 'turmeric', 'may', 'help', 'reduce', 'risk', 'factors', 'associated', 'heart', 'disease', 'high', 'blood', 'pressure', 'oxidized', 'ldl', 'cholesterol', 'inflammation', 'may', 'contribute', 'cardiovascular', 'health', 'br', 'brsupport', 'digestive', 'health', 'turmeric', 'may', 'promote', 'digestive', 'health', 'stimulating', 'bile', 'production', 'liver', 'aiding', 'digestion', 'fats', 'additionally', 'antiinflammatory', 'properties', 'may', 'help', 'relieve', 'symptoms', 'digestive', 'disorders', 'irritable', 'bowel', 'syndrome', 'inflammatory', 'bowel', 'disease', 'br', 'brpotential', 'anticancer', 'effects', 'studies', 'suggest', 'curcumin', 'may', 'anticancer', 'effects', 'inhibiting', 'growth', 'spread', 'cancer', 'cells', 'helping', 'prevent', 'development', 'certain', 'types', 'cancer', 'br', 'brwhile', 'turmeric', 'offers', 'range', 'health', 'benefits', 'it39s', 'important', 'note', 'research', 'needed', 'confirm', 'fully', 'understand', 'effects', 'however', 'incorporating', 'turmeric', 'diet', 'spice', 'supplement', 'may', 'simple', 'way', 'potentially', 'improve', 'overall', 'health']"

While it is true that the cause is complex and beyond what we can control, this begs the question whether I was already predisposed to insulin resistance though seems unlikely with my persistently low a1c number. <br><br>I guess my point is having a relaxed approach toward dietary pattern and using the mindset of “eat in moderation” including occasional treats, may be beneficial for a lot of people, but it’s still would be better to avoid ultra processed, hyper palatable, sugary, refined carbs altogether.
