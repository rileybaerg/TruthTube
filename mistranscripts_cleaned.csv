2,G4guVvCYAEA,the absolute number one most inflammatory food in the world is ultr processed foods now this is a group or a category of foods composed of primarily three ingredients yes it has preservatives and colorings and artificial flavorings and that type of thing but it's composed of synthetic sugars synthetic starches and synthetic oils and I'm talking about highly highly refined food particles that don't resemble the original food so you can even take corn for example turn into starch and then turn into a fiber and turn into a sugar and of course turn into an oil right if we were to eliminate ultrapress Foods in all these forms it's in cereals and cookies and bars and candy and chips we will eliminate 99% of all inflammation 
3,u0-U3-f4VHM,you know if you went to your kitchen right now and looked in your spice rack in your cupboard you probably would have this right here this is called ginger right well did you realize that Ginger is one of the most amazing things for bloating for any type of inflammation nausea motion sickness and immune system not to mention a lot of other things so if you have any of these problems you can use this in smoothies in a tea in various recipes I think a lot of people like have different things around the house but they don't even know what they actually do so if you have any of these symptoms you might want to start using more Ginger 
4,llDg68l626M,all right we're at our favorite restaurant KFC and let's see we got we have uh these things right here let's see if it bounces yeah it does all right so now we have our wonderful chicken right here right we have our tub delicious chicken highly addictive some of the first ingredient is MSG okay then they have mulle textured which is a another uh thing that will really spike your blood sugars and then when they cook this with oils they use seed oils you're going to create a lot of um inflammatory things but I want to just mention the MSG in here because there's some resar reports that says that it was back checked right and it said that msgd has have been found to be safe well not if you're consuming a lot of it over a period of time it's an ingredient that will stimulate hunger and make you want to eat more and more and more so I want to share with you a couple of the things creas liver toxicity impaired fertility CH development cardiovascular toxicity and neurotoxicity other than that it's totally safe 
5,OahN4mwd6C4,now think about what breathing problems involve right the diaphragm so you here you have this gallbladder /b duct issue congestion whatever you want to call it that backs up that that breathing apparatus and that can affect your breathing big timeon and this usually can be easily corrected by changing your diet to the healthy version of the ketogenic diet within a minute fasting but as an immediate remedy you want to take something called tdka it's a type of Bol that is very unique because it helps to increase the flow of bile sludge through the bile duck so you would take two of these in the morning on an empty stomach and then 2 in the afternoon on an empty stomach and within a few days you'll just feel a lot better 
6,VghsZO9QO_M,so right now in your kitchen in your cupboard you probably have this right garlic powder this is like a natural remedy for so many different things okay blood pressure control cholesterol control decreasing your risk for cancer it's antiviral it's actually considered a broad spectrum antimicrobial so if you're concerned about any of the symptoms that I mentioned start including this simple remedy in your foods 
7,9tHeg6Iq1kk,there's this carb that is way more dangerous than sugar okay now people tend to think sugar is the worst thing but there's other things that are even worse than sugar and this specific carb is bad and I'm going to tell you why we take a look at the glycemic index where is Sugar well table sugar is about 65 not terribly High where's glucose 100 where is this carbohydrate between 116 and 136 on the glycemic index so in other words it's a carb that's not classified as a sugar but acts like a sugar in a much more deadly way as far as what it can do to your blood sugars it just will really spike it and this carb is called maltodextrin it's in other forms too it's in modified food starch it's in modified corn starch I mean and it's in many foods they put in a lot of sugar-free products as no sugar even though it really to me it is a sugar so start reading the labels and avoid maltodextrin 
8,AD2sPmVxcwU,zinc is involved in so many different things it's involved in 300 different enzymes and over a thousand different factors related to your DNA its functions are very wide in helping certain enzymes not just for digestion but for a lot of other things and if you can identify early signs of a zinc deficiency sometimes they call it a subclinical deficiency then you can prevent Advanced problems related to zinc and that can include a complete loss of appetite and then you end up having anorexia necrosis because the tissue is not healing and so zinc actually helps with wound healing and if you're deficient in zinc you can develop uh ulcers externally or internally on your body even ulcers in your mouth and even some elderly that have these ulcers because they're in this bed and they're unhealing ulcers or or wounds um they need zinc big time 
9,IjQJkjrXCC4,I think you already know that stress can also cause disease too right it can cause ulcers heart attacks it can cause osteoporosis it can cause high blood pressure it can cause anxiety depression all sorts of mood problems and it can also suppress your immune system to the point where you develop infections or maybe a virus that was in remission comes out of remission 
10,L59jXhtPvNM,all right today we're going to talk about Burger King and the impossible burger that you can get for $6.50 so the first ingredient is this completely brand new protein called leg hemoglobin okay it's from a GMO soy so they turned soy into this interesting protein a completely brand new protein the safety studies were only done for 28 days and it's generally recognized as safe because the industry says it's generally oriz is safe there is no FDA approval process all right what's in here we have soy oil corn oil cultured dextro which is synthetic sugar food starch modified which I think is another name for modified food starch soy protein isolates now to make that you have to add hexane which is a solvent and methyl cellulose which is used as a laxative so please tell me what ingredient in here is healthier than any other Burger 
11,A2x33zFsTLA,my terrible painful heartburn was the best thing that ever happened to me there are three things to do but one of these things that I'm going to share with you will actually correct it let's start with number three you want to add more acid to the stomach like either apple cider vinegar or Bane hydrochloride and that will acidify the stomach and you'll start to feel better all right number two add sea salt to the diet and maybe an electrolyte powder with more potassium because both pottassium and the chloride for the sodium chloride is needed to build hydrochloric acid but the most important thing you can do to correct this problem is to support the valve on the top of the stomach by taking a natural B1 because when you're deficient in thymine which I was you can't produce the acid in the stomach in the first place and of course I was doing so much sugar it was depleting all my B1 and if you want to see the whole video on this go to my YouTube channel and check it out 
12,afWHeLiejPY,to lose your belly fat there are three tips that you need to know relating to doing intermittent fasting and one of these tips is way more important than the others tip number one make sure you have enough sea salt because if you don't have enough sea salt when you're doing fasting you're going to have keto fatigue you're going to feel tired and weak and you're not going to be able to sleep tip number two do not go into this with any preset fasting schedule instead let your appetite dictate how long you fast for so in other words if you're not hungry don't eat but the most important tip I can give you is this force your body to only burn belly fat 24/7 by reducing your carbs as close to zero as possible and the way that you do that is to combine meat with vegetables skip the breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes muffin sodas and juice and for more intermittent fasting tips check out my YouTube channel 
13,ntQ5IbULu7U,if you have any inflammation on the right side of your body okay I don't care if it's fibromyalgia or shoulder pain or a headache on the right side or anything down in the lower part of your body as well suspect something related to the gallbladder and it could be just the bile ducts themselves being congested with what's called bile sludge which a lot of people don't even know about that they they think automatically you have to have a gall stone but not necessarily there could be some sludge which is really the stage before a gallstone develops you start having this super concentrated amount of cholesterol um because there's not enough bile salts 
14,W_8nrFXzw_4,if you are deficient in calcium you may find that you have this chronic cough okay and you may find that um you're tired but you just can't go to sleep there's something preventing you from just drifting off into a nice relaxed sleep that's a Calcium deficiency uh not to mention you could have cramps as well that could be a calcium or a magnesium deficiency 
15,pY1fV-P1YnI,"you know I talk a lot about vitamin D but I wouldn't recommend taking vitamin D by itself I would always take vitamin K2 with vitamin D because vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption in your intestines by 20 times and that ends up in the blood so you can have a lot of calcium in the blood which can be a problem for people especially if they're prone to kidney stones or arthritis but vitamin K2 comes to the rescue and that takes the calcium from the blood and pushes it into the bone one of the really important things that vitamin K2 does is to prevent soft tissue calcium from accumulating that could be in your arteries or the joints or any organ so to protect you against any potential side effects of vitamin D3 make sure you take vitamin K2 at the same time as far as the ratios go for every 10,000 I use of vitamin D3 take 100 micrograms of vitamin K2 "
16,6nnp1YJF1OA,all right so today we're at one of my favorite restaurants paries okay so today we have some fries which is a great combination between soy or corn canola oil and a starch under high Heats which is going to create cation that's going to accumulate in the body it's going to build up in the lens of the eye and your brain and the tissues and arteries highly inflammatory okay so we also have this right here which is honey mustard and then we have of course our chicken tenders right now lift up the ingredients for that and this is loaded with MSG now there's a bunch of people out line saying oh yeah they just finally found out to fact checking that it's totally safe well why do they use it to fatten rats they actually have to fatten them up with MSG so monoid glate does increase insulin which means it's going to cause a fat liver and make you gain weight and it's going to make you hungrier and this is why when you start eating this you can't stop all right I will see you in the next video 
17,DavA5kfaqaU,you know so many people have blood sugar problems they're worried about their diabetes pre-diabetes Etc well in your cupboard right now you probably have an amazing remedy it's in the spice rack it's called cinnamon cinnamon has been known to drop your blood sugars because it supports the cells in the pancreas called the beta cells it helps to reverse insulin resistance it helps to decrease A1C and because it addresses the blood sugars it also helps you with all the things that are connected to that like helping you lose weight getting rid of fat off your liver and help regulate your cholesterol but also realize at the same time you take this also get rid of your sugar this is just going to speed up your results so of course when you take cinnamon don't put it on toast with sugar okay you want to get rid of the sugar as you add the cinnamon because the cinnamon will enhance the results you can use it in different recipes you can use it in a shake you can use it in your teas but for all problems related to blood sugars think cinnamon 
18,nqpMzWGPxHo,if you can't sleep right you're getting less than 5 hours and you have this sympathetic overdrive and you're trying to lose weight good luck it's not going to happen in fact you can work with someone on their diet but boy if the sleep is not right and they're also exercising at the same time you just wasting your time getting someone into a wonderful rejuvenating sleep that can create huge changes in weight loss 
19,o_SS8cGGFbI,so you have the spine you have all these different ribs that connect to the spine but this articulation between the rib and the spine and your back if it's restricted can affect your breathing very easily now how could that occur well easily from an injury 
20,yUNWFEiJb6I,all right rabbit D today and we want to talk about these right here um man are these addictive so you have a combination of different oils they're all seed oils corn canola soy soy hydrogenated oils which basically make it thicker we have beef flavoring with wheat and dairy concentrate and don't forget dextrose which is a synthetic sugar now here's the thing you need to know about seed oils when they're under heat you're going to develop something called glycation glycation makes you look older creates a effects like diabetes Alzheimers waine liver fat but there's something more Insidious about this if you're consuming these seed oils on a regular basis they can accumulate to the cells and create all sorts of inflammation and they have a half-life of basically 2 and a half to three years I mean the sugar in ha will burn off fairly quickly but these oils get stuck deep inside yourselves 
21,z4Lx1x6mNVc,what does acid reflex or silent reflex have to do with your breathing well apparently there's a lot of um sensory nerves in your esophagus that go right to your brain and that will give your brain certain information that it's not getting enough oxygen which will cause you to feel like you have air hunger it will cause you to breathe more and gasp or air it'll cause you to yawn more and when you breathe more sometimes it creates almost not like a hyperventilation but you get too much oxygen and not enough CO2 okay now you would think that would allow you to breathe better but what's interesting about the relationship between oxygen and CO2 is that you need a certain level of CO2 to allow oxygen to go into your red blood cells and so if you have just straight oxygen without enough CO2 you won't be able to get enough oxygen into the cells 
22,D318YEnHPeg,so I recently did a video on how to get rid of a wart or a skin tag using this amazing amazing remedy that I just stumbled on and instead of giving you the long name for this remedy I'm just going to tell you it's an ahcc this is a shitake mushroom extract it has the ability to clear out the herpes virus okay and this is based on over a 100 randomized control trials so for anything related to the herpes virus you you should check out this ahcc you can go watch my complete video on this topic at drberg.com 
23,lCHoCeUdoII,what does acid reflex or silent reflex have to do with your breathing well apparently there's a lot of um sensory nerves in your esophagus that go right to your brain and that will give your brain certain information that it's not getting enough oxygen which will cause you to feel like you have air hunger it will cause you to breathe more and gasp or air it'll cause you to yawn more and when you breathe more sometimes it creates almost not like a hyperventilation but you get too much oxygen and not enough CO2 okay now you would think that would allow you to breathe better but what's interesting about the relationship between oxygen and CO2 is that you need a certain level of CO2 to allow oxygen to go into your red blood cells and so if you have just straight oxygen without enough CO2 you won't be able to get enough oxygen into the cells 
24,FJj5mY2KS2M,so I have a question for you when you're at the grocery store and you are at the tiny little corner of the store called the health food section what does that tell you about the rest of the grocery store what kind of foods are they serving there trying to figure that out did you realize that 83% of all the calories in the grocery store are Ultra processed foods AKA junk Foods Ultra processed foods are not really foods but there's something that don't actually resemble the starting food that they process them from or they refine them from I think it'd be very important especially if you have children to watch my video on alter processed foods um on YouTube because that will give you a lot more information in deciding what you should buy and what you shouldn't buy at the grocery store 
25,vSMmAjFCP4w,I'd like to talk about vitamin D and magnesium okay did you realize that the receptors for absorbing vitamin D are completely and utterly dependent on magnesium if you have no magnesium you will not be able to absorb vitamin d and vitamin D helps you absorb magnesium the majority of the population are not only deficient in vitamin D but also magnesium and without enough magnesium you tend to get calcium deposits that build up in the joints and the arteries so make sure when you take a vitamin D supplement it also comes with magnesium and the other co-actors 
26,f54Fr1Nidaw,want to show you how to make the healthiest lemonade in the world now why is it so healthy because it has zero sugars most lemonade has like 7 and 1/2 teaspoons of sugar let me show you how simple it is you're basically going to take one cup of water okay and then you'll squeeze the juice from one lemon or 4 tablespoons of lemon juice and lastly you just add three drops of this liquid Stevia now it doesn't have to be lemon flavored it could just be plain but these three drops will make it very very sweet and very very delicious and I promise you won't even know the difference between this lemonade and the sugar filled lemonade and I think you're going to be shocked to find out how delicious this sweetened lemonade is with absolutely zero sugars 
27,U1dEuvAFTNU,When you sweat uh it's really salty and then also if you're drinking a lot of plain water without salt you're just going to create a situation where you're going to actually be very deficient in salt just as a side note one of the first symptoms of a salt or sodium deficiency is uh muscle weakness okay you feel very very weak 
28,seoNCxlrmM0,I want to discuss the top mistakes that people make when they start intermittent fasting number one eating way too much what you have to realize is that when you're not eating you are eating you're eating your own fat so it's not that you're starving mistake number two eating too much of the wrong thing and even if it's keto friendly eating too much peanut butter or almond flour or spinach or even chocolate all are loaded with oxalates and that can make you worse and many times also people eat the wrong type of peanut butter the best type of peanut butter that has the lowest amount of afot toxins is organic Valencia peanut butter and if you add that with celery you can really reduce any side effects or bad things that come along with eating peanut butter and the third mistake that people make is not consuming B vitamins and electrolytes when you're doing fasting because when you fast you might exaggerate an existing deficiency that you already have 
29,Nrl_X5wE0uw,I want to discuss the top mistakes that people make when they start intermittent fasting number one eating way too much what you have to realize is that when you're not eating you are eating you're eating your own fat so it's not that you're starving mistake number two eating too much of the wrong thing and even if it's keto friendly eating too much peanut butter or almond flour or spinach or even chocolate all are loaded with oxalates and that can make you worse and many times also people eat the wrong type of peanut butter the best type of peanut butter that has the lowest amount of afot toxins is organic Valencia peanut butter and if you add that with celery you can really reduce any side effects or bad things that come along with eating peanut butter and the third mistake that people make is not consuming B vitamins and electrolytes when you're doing fasting because when you fast you might exaggerate an existing deficiency that you already have 
30,vDa8341QhNw,"so I wanted to respond to an article um on how OIC in wovi could break the Health Care system because now if you have these weight loss drugs that are actually helping people lose weight and so now insurance companies and Medicare and now have to pay for all this medication which is very very expensive it's over $1,000 a month you know on one hand you might think well wow if someone loses weight they'll have so many Less Problems healthwise right but with OIC in wovi it comes with a package I mean I know people taking it now are developing end problems thyroid issues muscle issues you see the big problem is that this solution comes with a package it comes with bigger problems the hcco system is already broken the system focuses on treating symptoms and giving you side effects which you then need more treatments for honestly I think the greatest thing that someone could do is get on the ketogenic diet with inter a minute fasting and they wouldn't need to be taking medications over and over and over for the rest of their life if you want to know how to do it in a healthy way go to drberg.com right now "
31,Hz6EBeJP3vI,there's even a condition called e a that's a condition where the person is water logged okay and it's creating a lot of swelling in the brain and that could easily come from just drinking too much water and this often occurs when someone is exercising and so this really pertains to athletes and people that exercise a lot especially people that do marathons and they're drinking a lot of water it could be quite dangerous 
32,RW7STOpaRvg,you know the other day I was shopping at the grocery store and I bought this right here keto friendly Duncan hindes chewy fudge brownie mix right is it too good to be true the answer is yes because when you actually read the ingredients it has a lot of great things but then it says it has modified tapioca starch what is that that is mtto dextrin this is like way worse than sugar on the glycemic index table sugar is 65 glucose is 100 maltodextrin is between 116 and 136 so when they say zero added sugar they're putting this carbohydrate in it that acts like sugar even worse than sugar you see they get you because they say it has zero grams of sugar but the carbs in here are way worse than sugar because they spike your blood sugars worse than sugar so the moral of story is read the ingredients even though it says ketofriendly 
33,6jSpyG0rRT0,so I have a question for you if you can answer this out of all the ingredients to ultrapress Foods or junk foods which ingredient out of all of those is the absolute worst and has the biggest negative influence over your health go ahead and comment down below I'm very curious what you're going to say and then in my next video I'll tell you what I think 
34,QifjPgYfIiE,takes is just a little bit of exercise to produce significant health benefits and I'm talking about lowering your risk for certain diseases and increasing your longevity living longer it doesn't take much exercise so hopefully this uh video will inspire you to start exercising doing some type of physical activity on a regular basis because exercise is the most potent natural medicine for living longer and counter ing diseases and I'm going to recommend over time that you um really work on establishing a fitness Reserve which correlates to a health Reserve that extra bit of Health buffer to counter these stresses that come in on our body and affect us in a negative way 
35,aT0rBaHMRns,did you realize that 71 to 83% of all the calories sold in the grocery store are what's considered ultr processed foods so this is food that has been severely altered to the point where it doesn't actually resemble food anymore and I'm talking about uh modified starches they might take some soybean right and extract the oil with all sorts of solvents and chemicals and then you end up with these vegetable oils so we have all the cereals the breads the snack foods then you have the canned foods and you have all the soda drinks and unfortunately these Ultra processed foods are very quickly replacing our traditional foods 
36,iwsdIX0_qK4,now you may just end up quitting sugar after watching this video I'm just warning you don't get mad at me I'm just the messenger there are 703 meta analysis that make up 8600 different studies on sugar and the conclusions are a high amount of added sugar okay is significantly associated with 45 negative health effects ranging from diabetes to asthma depression stroke heart attack gout hyper tension dementia cancer and early death 
37,oEvhzW_lbTM,"so there was a quite large study there was I think over 80,000 people involved in this study called the nurse's health study and they looked over four years of who gained weight and who didn't gain weight and they looked at variables and they found an interesting uh association between drinking coffee and losing weight they found that increasing one cup of coffee unsweetened or decaffeinated every single day resulted in a moderate reduction in weight about .12 kg and they also observed that those who added sugar to their coffee actually gained weight I think it was like 09 kg well the problem with the study it's an observational study which means they use questioners which means that it's very very weak and not too credible so to lose weight I wouldn't put all your eggs into that one basket of drinking more coffee each day instead I have a great idea go to my site and download the healthy version of the ketogenic diet and that will help you lose weight "
38,fbIz1ozqRYQ,[Music] [Music] [Music] yeah oh my [Music] [Music] God that is awesome I want to do that I want to do that in fact I got my device in the mail so I'm ready to hook myself up I I'll show you in the next video 
39,Y8XQNFyMe8M,what is the number one best anti-inflammatory food in the entire world can you take a guess you think it's omega-3 Fetti acids fish oils not even close there are so many things that create inflammation we have gluten we have refined sugars seed oils alcohol junk food etc etc but most inflammatory conditions I'm talking about autoimmune I'm talking about arthritis type problems originate in the gut and you can drink all the fish oil you want it's not going to do anything you must change your diet okay and the primary food that I'm going to recommend that can heal the gut which is the food that has the most glutamine glutamine is like a Healer of your gut and the food that has the most glutamine is red meat okay beef that is the food that is the best healer for your gut 
40,KD2zUbWrkAM,all right another Factor that's very important is the frequency of eating okay if you're snacking if you're eating between meals if you're even eating three meals a day that can slow things down why because one of the triggers for insulin the fat storing hormone is eating in general so the less you eat the better the less you snack the better any food uh will stimulate insulin and then that will make you a little bit more hungry so we want to get you in a state where you're um burning your fat and you're satisfied and you're not hungry anymore so we want to combine the low carb with eating less frequent like 2 meals a day or even one meal a day that will produce huge effects and because you're not craving it'll make it easier to do 
41,wi6SHudf2PY,there's other things that cause a deficiency of biotin that you need to know if you consume raw egg whes because it locks up biotin if you're on the ketogenic diet your demand for biotin goes up because of how much fat that you're consuming and how much more of an increased demand biotin is going to be needed to deal with the fat this could explain why someone that goes on a ketogenic diet without necessarily enhancing their diet with biotin could potenti end up with either a skin rash or hair loss or hair thinning 
42,32K_bo7E66M,foods that create the most inflammation would be related to something like gluten which actually is in grains most of the grains create inflammation in your gut most people with arthritis don't know it but their grains that they're eating are creating a lot of inflammation then you have the obvious things like alcohol sugar junk Foods another name for Junk Foods would be ultr process foods did you realize that 83% of all the calories in the grocery store are Ultra process foods and we wonder why our digestive system is so messed up 
43,Kfn7YpAlmPs,now I hate to break this to you but that mother and the oppsite of vinegar and the bottom of the bottle is not what you think what you've been told it's a special mixture of friendly bacteria and maybe certain enzymes that are going to help you well what they didn't tell you is this you can't see friendly bacteria you can't see enzymes what that sediment really is at the bottom of the bottle it's un filtered fiber many companies that have the so-called mother actually Heat their aloid of vinegar they use high pressure and both heat and high pressure destroy those enzymes and friendly bacteria so the secret of having the true mother in an alider vinegar bottle is finding a company that sells raw alider vinegar that doesn't use high pressures and the one that I like the best is called fairchild's not brags but fairchild's aloc cider vinegar 
44,Ba6QLhycpy8,[Music] [Music] [Music] yeah oh my [Music] [Music] God that is awesome I want to do that I want to do that in fact I got my device in the mail so I'm ready to hook myself up I I'll show you in the next video

46,gO0mUN3MAoM,if you wanted an amazing drink to drop inflammation in your body especially inflammation in your gut here's the best drink and this is based on a YouTube video that I did recently but I will say you need a juicer for this but you're going to juice cabbage okay it's the cabbage juice fresh and raw and organic that is high in glutamine that can really help your gut heal if there's any inflammation or there's an ulcer apparently there's a vitamin u in cabbage that can greatly help you so I would recommend to juice one glass of cabbage juice every single day drink it down and watch your inflammation disappear 
47,3BbcD0fjfno,so I'm really excited to speak at the upcoming Health hacking event forly called ketocon and so the topic of my uh presentation is going to relate to the ketogenic diet and how to implement uh prolong fasting with the ketogenic diet in a very unique way and I'm also going to be sharing with you the real deeper reason why keto and low carb is being censored so you don't want to miss this I can't wait to meet you in person I will see you at the end end of May

49,Ika6xrj1L40,really got to be careful of these grains uh and consume only grains if you're going to do grains at all that have no gluten and that would be oat quinoa Millet TEF buckwheat and then just like a nut flour you can use almond flour and anytime you are consuming grains nuts legumes things like that you want to germinate those because you want to get rid of certain antinutrients and one being this phytic acid so what you could do is you simply soak these things in water with 1 tblspoon apple cider vinegar and then let that sit for about 7 to 12 hours okay and then you rinse it out and then you can actually bake with it or cook with it whatever and that way you'll get rid of a lot of the antinutrients because this fyc acid will really block the zinc selenium iron calcium things like that 
50,8JySMhsH72M,does drinking water actually hydrate you the answer is it depends it depends on what's going on with sodium if you have a lot of sodium in the body and not enough water you're going to be dehydrated but on the flip side if you don't have enough sodium and you have too much water you will also be dehydrated perfect examples let's say it's summertime and you're sweating and you're losing all of this water in sodium and you start guzzling all this water you are literally dehydrating yourself because you're diluting that sodium so sodium helps you retain the water to give you the volume that you need and without the volume your blood pressure drops and you have all sorts of issues so to be hydrated yes you need water but you also need electrolytes especially sodium and this especially is relevant if you have diarrhea or vomiting or you suddenly lose a lot of fluid and electrolytes from sweating you want more information about this check out my video on hydration on YouTube 
51,xsvsonsP3BU,"ketogenic diet can absolutely kill you this is Steven L lifestyle medicine cardiologist and in this video I'm going to tell you that the ketogenic diet can absolutely kill you we're going to go through what the ketogenic diet is the science behind the risks that the ketogenic diet has and then what you should be doing really to get yourself healthy lose weight and live a long healthy life so if the ketogenic diet kills people why do I have 7,829 success stories a people let say the complete opposite "
52,EmGwQA2C1UM,one of the most important nutrients for your hair is a simple amino acid called Lucine without Lucine you can very easily develop alopecia thinning of the hair and actually hair loss itself Lucine stimulates collagen especially in your hair making sure your hair is strong and elastic another interesting thing about Lucine is it helps you absorb iron which a deficiency is commonly involved in hair loss so what is the best source of Lucine red meat you can also get it from fish chicken and eggs 
53,JeaF9HtuVxA,now the second point about probotics is we have to talk about the opposite of a prootic which is an antibiotic um there are things out there that mimic antibiotics as well like glyphosate which is an herbicide in all the GMO foods that you are exposed to and also certain artificial sweeteners can act as an antibiotic as well also antibiotics are grossly overused like for example most respiratory infections are usually viral not bacterial but over 75% of the time doctors prescribe antibiotics for upper respiratory infections most sinus problems are viral okay so if you give an antibiotic to someone with a viral infection guess what it won't work in fact that antibiotic will weaken your immune system so then the virus has an advantage so you might end up prolonging the viral infection 
54,QEzFBI-Z7qY,so there's a certain amount of sugar that you have to put in certain foods to optimize this Bliss moment this point of like wow this is just delicious and what happens in the brain is you get this spike in endorphins endorphins give you the sensation of pain relief of stress relief of wellbeing of Happiness pleasure so it's training us that if you feel bad or if you want more pleasure you just need to keep eating this thing and this is really what's behind an addiction 
55,z-atfvHSsqk,there are many uh non-pathological reasons why you might have high blood glucose that don't indicate that you really have diabetes or a problem for example if you test your blood sugars after you just worked out especially high intensity your blood sugars will be higher that's normal if you measured your blood sugars after a stress event your blood sugars are going to be higher if you measured your blood sugars after an infection or a night of not sleeping your blood sugars will be higher but these don't indicate that you just ate sugar or a bunch of carbs so the best way to differentiate between a pathological problem with your blood sugars and another reason it's really by what you eat if you're not eating a lot of carbs your blood sugars should be lower unless there's another reason for it 
56,g3zWxCcBeOY,if you want to know the most poisonous foods on the planet and I'm not going into sugar refined carbs and Seed oils which we know create more problems than any other food now mushrooms are very very delicious I love them but you have to be careful because there's some poisonous mushrooms out there that could actually kill you the most deadly mushroom out there is called the death cap mushroom and that's correctly named because it can kill you what you need to know is there's an antidote okay and it's pretty much almost every where if you're out in a farm or a field it's called milk thistle just today I was looking at all the milk thistle floating around with these little parachutes all over my yard but the seeds and milk thistle is the antidote to this poisonous mushroom it's also the antidote to the Venom and poisonous snakes Tylenol poisoning and many other poisons so remember milk thistle for a major protection of your liver 
57,2PaIdKUPDkI,hey just want to let you know that I'm going to be speaking at the keto Summit in Florida coming up in January it's called Symposium for metabolic Health it's in boa Raton Florida January 12th through the 14th and I haven't done one of these events in a very long time I'm very excited to do one I hope I can finally meet you in person and the last couple years I've been sitting in front of this darn computer sharing information about health but I really really miss meeting people in person that have been watching my content and uh chatting with you so I really hope I meet you at this keto event coming up real soon I put all the details down below go ahead and sign up and I will see you real soon 
58,Qk_bJoj8f-E,really interesting thing about a diabetic on a good portion of their high blood sugar it may not be 100% from the diet in fact it's not a good portion of their high sugar is because the liver is making too much glucose it's making out of protein and even fat and even ketones 
59,rs6Ztq7YrpE,now if you want to get more energy you want to focus in on this amazing cell in your body called the mitochondria the mocher is a pre- battery machine it actually makes a lot of batteries and that battery is ATP did you realize that your body actually makes your weight in ATP every single day ATP is the energy currency of the body and ATP is not stored it's made on demand unless you understand it and support it with all the co-actors like B vit vins magnesium zinc coenzym Q10 as well as certain foods that will help build a mitochondria you may find that you're never able to get your energy past a certain point now if you really want to take your energy to the next level search out my video on YouTube that I just released on fatigue and in that video I'm going to show you exactly what to do 
60,B1D7bjFMPC4,people that have a slow metabolism actually have a very efficient metabolism probably from dieting in the past you go on some diet and then your body adapts and compensates especially if you go on a lower calorie diet and then becomes more efficient so now it can run on a smaller amount of fuel it doesn't want to waste this energy so it's very conservative so it's like a car that gets a lot of miles per gallon right versus the very in efficient motor which is a gas guzzler 
61,1RRwbp9YMLA,did you realize that the average person in the US consumes like 60% of their calories from Ultra processed foods where they strip the nutrients out I mean let's just take Doritos for example I used to love Doritos I would consume huge bags of Doritos in college I mean just massive amounts and the next morning I would end up with all sorts of fluid retention in my fingers and my feet and at the time I had no information about health I was the worst so back then I think they put 11 ingredients in these Doritos and now it's I think up to 30 ingredients different flavors that just make it taste like you're dipping a taco with hot wings into ranch dressing and so is there a lot of potassium in Doritos no there's a lot of sodium in all these fast food restaurants 
62,5EnsvmwexjY,now vitamin A is very very important in your eyes for your immune system and for your skin not just external but internal skin too the skin that aligns the inside of your sinuses your throat your lungs as well as your digestive system and the best source of true vitamin A and I'm talking about the active form called retinol is not from consuming a lot of kale spinach or carrots or squash all of the plant-based vitamin A are precursors to true vitamin A which is called retinol beta carotene in plant sources can convert over to retinol but it's not very efficient so to get the best source of vitamin A okay you want either codiv oil egg yolks grass-fed butter liver cheese or fish 
63,cydV-nZEyk4,I'd like to talk about the amazing benefits of magnesium so magnesium actually helps you lower cortisol so it helps you sleep especially getting to sleep as well as staying asleep magnesium is also at the heart of making energy so if you're low in magnesium you might be tired all the time but the biggest reason I like magnesium is what it can do for your muscles if you have hard muscles if you have muscles that are in spasm all the time if you have muscles that are cramping especially at night you want magnesium the best type of magnesium that I would Rec recomend is called magnesium glycinate for the full information on magnesium check out my YouTube videos on magnesium 
64,Bz3DLaEF-ec,so I started looking at Copper in relationship to the satic nerve and I found some fascinating information number one there's all sorts of different types of therapy that use copper for inflammation and pain like copper bracelets copper patches copper cream and even a a brace that you could wrap around your upper hip area that can cover the satic nerve or at least the origin of the satic nerve and it's Lac with copper and a lot of people are reporting amazing results with that and we don't really know exactly why copper can help pain and inflammation and I'm talking about just topically putting it on the body I mean something could be actually potentially kind of being absorbed maybe but maybe not but I know copper is a very conductive um metal and so maybe it does something with the electrical fields that are out of balance in the area of pain I don't know 
65,xyNjoCrJW54,the pH in your stomach should be between one and three very very acidic and the purpose of that acidity is to help you break down protein is to help you absorb minerals also uh absorb B12 as well as to kill off pathogens right I'm talking about bacteria fungus parasites that could be in your food okay it's kind of a natural barrier your immune barrier and so as we age we lose this stomach acid people that are taking and acids are putting their pH in their stomach in the wrong direction Because the actual cause of heartburn gir an acid reflux most of the time is this your stomach acids are not strong enough in that valve at the top of the stomach is not closing so you're regurgitating acids 
66,lbdYjujrBTA,to remove fat from your liver just drink this one cup every single day now I know you're saying no freaking way is this going to work but just hear me out it'll make sense most of the fat on our livers is coming because of insulin resistance okay and out of all the things that are very powerful to help reverse insulin resistance apple cider vinegar is at the top of the list what you're simply going to do is take a glass of water and you're going to add one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar my favorite is Fair child's not brags because brags dilutes their apple of vinegar then you're going to add to it lemon juice you can do a tablespoon of lemon juice or just squeeze the juice from an actual lemon the combination of lemon which by the way helps to remove fat off your liver and apple ceter vinegar which helps you with insulin resistance can put you in a condition where your body actually releases the fat from the liver for the complete information of why this works check out my YouTube channel 
67,nTXr3WH033Y,next topic is about carbohydrates if you do a workout and you do a little snack before during or after the workout like a lot of people do they want to get those carbs in there maybe they do a protein bar with sugar or they might do an energy drink Gatorade with sugar you're shutting down the benefits of you know ketosis fat burning as well as autophagy which is the recycling of old damaged proteins in your body the kind of the anti-aging effect so here you are spending all this energy doing this workout and then this little bit of carb pretty much just nullifies the benefits especially if you are trying to lose weight around the midsection it's very beneficial to build up to the point where you exercise in a fasting State maybe eat the next hour or hour and a half or two hours later that would actually give you more improvements 
68,vH0rhTPEShI,sometimes people when they get on the ketogenic diet they feel that the muscles are just flat they kind of lost their size they look dehydrated because um when you do keto at least initially you lose your glycogen stores glycogen is basically the storage of glucose a lot of water and potassium and when you initially cut down your carbs okay you're going to also use up some of your glycogen reserve and you're going to lose water water weight okay and uh then your body's going to burn more fat you're going to get leaner 
69,tbAmKJecACA,you know slightly older people that were born in the 50s and the 60s like myself notied that there just wasn't as many overweight people back then why is that was it because we ate less saturated fats no is it because we ate Less meat no is it because we smoked or drank less no we actually drank more and we smoked more back then but nowadays we consume high fructose corn syrup seed oils which we didn't nearly do back then because we did mostly saturated fat and the last thing which is very interesting snacking back then we nearly didn't do as much snacking as we do now because what people need to know is every time you snack you spike insulin to a certain degree and insulin is behind so many problems especially with weight 
70,PF1siw7tXeY,so these microbes from kefir actually go into the body and they inoculate or seed your microbes to help you grow more microbes and actually the right balance and the microb from kefir actually can survive the stomach acid whereas yogurt it doesn't survive now there's definitely benefits to Yogurt because it can act like a food for certain things in your gut but kefir actually is a probiotic okay that can help your gut by providing the precursor to melatonin but also it can help lower cortisol which is the main stress hormone 
71,HR2ogA32znQ,now as you see when you buy biotin supplements or you see them in certain shampoos you'll see very high amounts of biotin now is that a problem uh not necessarily because biotin is water salable can Biotin in a cream or a shampoo be absorbed by your skin and the answer is yes and the benefits of using it as a shampoo or taking it oral as a pill is this if you have a subclinical okay a slight deficiency of biotin you may end up with thinning of the hair hair loss and you may end up with skin rashes primarily of your face now that's a subclinical deficiency okay so this can happen if you just had antibiotics or you just are not fortified with enough of the right microbes or you're just not consuming enough of it from the diet 
72,4UFJDlYNraw,insulin is really necessary it's a normal hormone we want it normal we don't want it too high or too low and unless you're a type 1 diabetic and have you know loss of the the cells that produce insulin usually when you are a diabetic or a pre-diabetic not type one but type two you can have a situation where you have high level of insulin and low level of insulin at the exact same time now how can that be well because the body develops this resistance so in this receptor um you have this blockage so the insulin comes out triggered by carbs goes into the receptor receptor is blocking it so we have low insulin inside the cell the feedback loop actually tells the pancreas to produce more 
73,R34IcLIgaaA,now I've been experimenting with this and I found that I'm getting a lot of recovery after I do uh this cold water immersion I have this unit that I jump into I use this after the workout it seems to be working very very well I have not added that the heat therapy after that but I'm going to experiment with that at some point but if you can add cold after the exercise or even heat whether it's a shower sauna warhole you can increase more benefits especially if you're someone like me that tends to have uh more genetics leaning towards inflammation and that's been my problem even in sports is that I have to be very careful of overtraining and I also have to put a lot of more attention on recovery between the exercise and of course I didn't know this when I was in sports and so I just work out a couple times a day seven days a week big mistake because at the end of the wrestling season I could barely walk 
74,qhv0_0n6zHw,so you probably heard of this Mediterranean diet being a healthy diet right um yes it might be true but what is not true about it it's not a plantbased diet like they say it is so yes they do grains they do breads the pasta and things like that but I've been over to those countries and I've observed firsthand that they consume a lot of pork they consume meat fish cheese it's not plant-based yes they do grains but they do a lot of meat products as well 
75,qqIAnbIL2J4,the beneficial bacteria and yeast in kefir can help break down the protein in milk like casine and other proteins into a digestible protein so even though a person has an allergy to milk um it's much less with kefir because of this microbial uh decomposition of the protein also kefer tends to eat up a good portion of the lactose the milk sugar which many people have a problem with they have lactose intolerance 
76,hKXNgZe6AHY,to help you lower your blood pressure I recommend drinking one cup of this every single day now before I tell you what this is I highly recommend you also get on the ketogenic diet make sure you have enough vitamin D in your diet as well as potassium but a really simple tea that you can drink every single day to help you lower your blood pressure and it can act as a natural ACE inhibitor is habiscus tea apparently the natural chemicals or compounds in habiscus Te which are called anthro zanthin act as a very powerful ACE inhibitor almost comparable with certain blood pressure medications so try it out there's really no downsides there's no side effects it's very inexpensive and so if this could potentially work that would be awesome 
77,iD4MYygfrvE,what OIC does to the body is it increases a certain receptor called glp1 which helps slow down digestion thereby decreasing your appetite Cravings so you're no longer hungry and you can eat less and lose more weight it even improves the beta cells of the pancreas to help restore insulin levels in fact it's been known to improve insulin resistance and anything that improves insulin resistance will help you lose weight it has some interesting effects on the liver too it actually helps a person stop making so much sugar okay that's called glucon Neal Genesis and also it helps slow the breakdown of sugar in the liver 
78,FK6etkdOgm8,so these people that are cutting out red meat they maybe doing chicken breast which has way too many uh omega-6 fatty acids and it's definitely of lesser quality and so is like plant-based protein that's like really low on the list whereas sometimes people think those are clean proteins to help you they're not there's other things you can do too you can do eggs and those are good but if you do eggs make sure they're not raw because the raw can deplete your Biotin and it's not nearly as bio avalable as the cooked eggs another protein that's not bad is uh a real good high quality cheese okay think about it where does cheese come from it comes from milk in nature when does an animal need milk when they're growing why because milk has a lot of growth factors to help muscle building and so a little bit of cheese can do wonders on your muscles for growth and increasing muscle size 
79,LNguvTPcPMs,when you're in a room when the windows are not open and you're not getting enough oxygen because maybe you don't also have enough plants in your room which give you oxygen you may have a tendency to have more CO2 in that room and just that alone can affect your sleep in a negative way and this is why when you open the window if you can or you get a plant next to where you're sleeping you can definitely sleep better just for the fact that you're increasing the oxygen and you're lowering the co 2 so many people are spending all day in a room with a higher level of CO2 and not enough oxygen 
80,YNVUc65A1sQ,you know there's some interesting root causes of sleep problems that you may have never considered before one is something related to sleep apnea but it's not really sleep apnea it's a situation where you just don't have enough oxygen going into your lungs because your pH of your blood is slightly to alkaline there's a condition called respiratory alkalosis and one root cause of that is not having the right amount of acids in your stomach and one clue that you have that problem is having acid reflux or G so a lot of people that have acid reflux or gird are taking and acids might develop some version of this respiratory alkalosis and that's going to affect the breathing it's going to affect the sleep and it's such a simple handling if you fix the root cause if you want the full information check out my video on YouTube 
81,b-0oVmjfiEU,there are several very important mistakes that people make when they do intermittent fasting the first one is not doing the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting and so it's going to be really hard to get into keto because your carbs are just a little too high the next mistake a lot of people make is eating too much in their eating window your eating window should really only be two meals with fasting in between those meals and also making sure that you don't overeat and stuff yourself which will create a lot of bloating and interfere with your sleep I think most popular uh pattern would be an 18-hour fast and a 6-hour eating window but from a lot of trial and error and working with a lot of people it's very important that your two meals uh be in the middle part of the day not extended too late because the later you eat the poorer quality of sleep you're going to get because your digestive system is constantly working to digest all that food so we really want an early dinner and a late lunch now to get the full information on this topic go to my YouTube channel 
82,jt1oERGNgzU,there's a condition called air hunger okay or another word for it would be dpia which is a situation where you just don't get enough oxygen that can create anxiety and typically people know that it comes from asthma or some like pneumonia or a lung infection or maybe COPD but there's another cause for it that you need to be aware of and it's called silent reflux where there's some acid that's regurgitating into your esophagus creating damage to the nerves signaling your brain stem to gasp air but the more important thing is how you treat it are you going to treat it with a medication or are you going to go with something more natural that has less side effects and one of the best remedies to help heal the esophagus of that inflammation would be chlorophyll and a really good source of chlorophile would be either wheat grass juice or wheat grass juice powder and adding a little water and drinking that through the day for more information on this specific topic go to my YouTube channel and search out air hunger 
83,TeEO1ng3iuA,so realize when you eat sugar you're kind of paralyzing your immune system and also when you eat sugar if you're female you're increasing your androgens okay that's there's a condition called PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome that comes from too much Androgen but that's really coming from too much insulin because their diet is too high in carbs and too much Androgen increases something called sebum which is the oil in the sebaceous gland or the oil gland which is the exact thing we're trying to regulate and improve and so the big takeaway is that too much sugar kind of paralyzes the uh immune system and allows these pathogenic bacteria to grow all over the place 
84,0rNBpyk_qmw,now if you're not consuming apple cider vinegar you might want to start let me tell you some of the benefits number one it helps insulin become more sensitive in other words insulin can now work normally which is going to help your blood sugars another benefit is to help remove fat off your liver how does it do that by fixing insulin because insulin is behind a fatty liver another big benefit is losing belly fat which is also related to number one fixing insulin another benefit is to help your lipids or your cholesterol ol levels helping you balance HDL with your LDL but how does it do that well with number one fixing insulin and lastly if you have like acid reflex or gird or bloating or indigestion apple cider vinegar will fix that simply just add one tablespoon to a glass of water before each meal and you're good 
85,m-lAMiyRr9w,now listen when you're trying to lose weight many times people have this idea I'm not exercising enough maybe I'm eating too much or maybe I'm just getting older or it's genetics those are really not the big reason there's something else that's a much bigger reason why people just can't lose weight and it's really two things one grazing at night eating those nuts late at night and snacking in between meals whether it's some little snack or some protein bar oh my gosh that snacking or eating between meals is a killer because snacking increases insulin and Insulin blocks fat burning and even if you're snacking on protein it doesn't matter it's going to stop you from losing weight so the big reason is not enough consistent intermittent fasting so just try this for three days just completely stop snacking I will promise you you will lose a lot of weight 
86,W04hrjwuz_U,trying to figure out how to State this um there's one thing that we know for sure about dopamine no one really understands the complexity of dopamine if you do a deep dive on dopamine your head is going to literally spin because there are so many theories just when they say they have it figured out um well no that doesn't work they'll say it's say motivation molecule or the thing that gives you pleasure or the thing that's involved with reward no it's not it's associated with these behaviors but it's not the thing that gives you these Sensations you give yourself these Sensations 
87,GsGEckgi0S0,now there are several ways to get probotics without taking a probiotic supplement so number one you want to consume fermented vegetables as in pickles sauerkraut or kimchi number two consume fermented dairy products you can do yogurt but I would recommend kefir kefir not only has friendly bacteria it has friendly yeast as well and that's extremely healthy for your body but just make sure you get the one without added sugar and the one that comes from whole milk and also if they have kefir made from either sheep milk or goat milk I would choose that now the last probiotic that I want to talk about which is quite surprising is raw vegetables that are grown from soil not hydroponically but from soil if you eat vegetables from your garden or the farmer market or from soil you will get a massive amount of probiotics because these raw vegetables are loaded with good bacteria and not only that the fiber can actually help feed your microbes as a Prebiotic 
88,M73Bm3tBteU,is this true or false one out of seven teens has either high blood pressure or elevated blood pressure what do you think well the answer is it's true i mean this blows me away we've never had this problem ever if you're a team to have high blood pressure or you know of one go to my website download the healthy keto plan and get them on it immediately 
89,-L1FScy3Jtg,now sulforaphane is a very powerful phytonutrient that can help in cancer anti-aging it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory but the question is what has more broccoli or broccoli sprouts well if you answered broccoli sprouts you are correct broccoli sprouts have literally 10 times the amount of sulforaphane than adult broccoli

124,ehzVVUNPKH8,did you know what the number one cause of liver transplant is in the united states it's actually taking tylenol and the problem with the drug and tylenol is that it's in a lot of other medications as well so if a person is taking things like a nyquil for example they're getting the drug from tylenol and it's actually quite easy to create a toxic effect and you should never go above four grams of tylenol in one day in fact you should probably keep it less than three grams just to make sure because if your liver is bad or fatty or inflamed your ability to handle and detoxify poisons are much less 
125,vjfVHloosgU,you know there's a really interesting study that i saw recently on salt it's actually a low salt diet that increases your risk for a heart attack so if you're consuming less than just one teaspoon a day your risk for heart attack goes up however your risk goes down if you increase your salt intake to two teaspoons per day now this especially applies to those of you on a ketogenic diet because when you start the keto plan you lose a lot of fluid however this does not apply to those people who retain fluid like those on a high carbohydrate diet so up your salt a little bit if you want to decrease your risk of a heart attack 
126,DCVx5GQb4gE,so ultra processed foods are not really foods they're highly refined flour products they're very high in carbohydrate very high on the glycemic index and they're very very deadly in the causation of diabetes heart disease and i'm not sure you knew this but children on average in america consume 67 of their calories as ultra processed so-called foods so if your kids are not on keto get them on keto immediately 
127,cHqWvJmRzI8,now as you know when you buy extra virgin olive oil a lot of it's fake like 80 of it is totally fake and there's a really good way to determine if it's the real extra virgin olive oil versus some fake version and that is this do you get this little tickle in the back of your throat if you do chances are it's the real extra virgin olive oil so if you take the olive oil and you get that little irritation the back part of your throat then you know it's the real stuff 
128,Wrv6erc3D7s,selenium very very important in your thyroid converting t4 to t3 but selenium is one of the most powerful antioxidants so take a while to guess what nut has the most selenium if you guess brazil nuts you're correct all it takes is one brazil nut every single day to get your daily requirements for selenium 
129,CghlQS3lQNw,so the question is what's easier to digest mct oil or coconut oil what do you think well mct oil is a hundred percent medium chain triglycerides whereas coconut oil is only 15 percent medium chain triglycerides and the unique thing about medium chain triglycerides is they turn into ketones pretty fast and they don't involve bile from the liver so mct oil is much easier to digest than coconut oil 
130,qB5lj50JdqM,you know it takes about 20 minutes to consume two cheeseburgers medium coke and a medium fries which basically is over a thousand calories but it's going to take three hours of intense exercise to burn off those thousand calories however if those thousand calories do not involve carbohydrates then the rules change because even if you don't exercise those calories are not going to be turned into fat and with being in a low carb diet your body can actually use those calories as energy but with a high carb diet you're not going to be able to use those fat calories as energy so the secret of whether you're going to burn fat or not has to do with how low your carbs are

538,UKH_5SR3wL8,supermarket runs does that get expensive it's got to be an expensive diet yeah so i mean it's you know it depends you know it depends on you know again how much i'm probably eating more than the average person that does this diet that i'm aware of generally goes about two pounds two pounds of meat and so they can be a day a day right and so a lot of people you know people that are that are uh you know don't have the budget they'll just do like ground beef and stuff like that you can do you can eat two pounds of ground beef for you know under 10 bucks a day which is right you know two cups of starbucks you know something like that yeah it's actually not that bad for a lot of people 
539,TMt_aYXiZ-g,was using 2700 milligrams of gabapentin per day that's 900 milligrams which is three 300 milligram pills three times a day for about eight years for uh neurotherapy in my feet burning my feet

541,F6LDh1m0JBU,there are a lot of people that only have a limited amount of income and they've got to you know choose their dollars and what they can spend it on and if if it comes to eating cheap processed carbohydrates versus cheap ground beef eat the cheap ground beef any day of the week i mean that that that's where it is i mean there's just as many people coming off of diabetic meds and depression meds and seeing their joint pain go away eating the supermarket meat they can afford 
542,4OcQWhWofoI,they just eat until they're not hungry anymore the problem is a lot of people lose weight on this you know a lot of people get lean on this stuff is that you know your hunger goes down pretty low because you're you know you're eating a lot of fat and a lot of protein you know especially if you're eating if you're eating ribeye steaks you know that's probably about 70 fat 30 protein something like that so i mean it's it's really really satisfying tend to they tend to under because no one's used to like if i sold you joe go eat four pounds of meat a day you're gonna be like well i mean i know you like eating meat but i mean even that's probably a big that's a lot it's a lot you know and so to get used to that it takes a while yeah you know it depends on your activity level because i work out pretty damn hard and i do it pretty often 
543,YvQwa2Ci2xA,so there was a nice study that dr peary did in i think 2012 looking at fiber intake and diverticular disease and she did i think it was like 2000 colonoscopies the people that ate the most fiber and had the most bowel movements had the highest rate of diverticular disease so it's like the total opposite so any time you test these epidemiology studies and john initis out of stanford one of the one of the most well respected and quoted researchers in the world has gone on to say that nutritional epidemiology is completely misguided 
544,5p3i0dHIbmo,apparently drinking a can of Coke is just like drinking a glass of orange juice to me an orange juice is just as bad for you as a can of Coke because they both contain 25 grams of sugar whoa whoa whoaa Whoa man let me talk to you about this these are not the same these affect our bodies very differently come on let me show you real orange juice is very different than this Coca-Cola there are clear studies in humans showing that when you drink orange juice the endothelium the inside of your blood vessels the lining of your blood vessels actually functions better and your cholesterol your LDL lipoproteins are less likely to oxidize that's a healthy thing that happens when you drink orange juice even though it has sugar in it but when you drink cocacola we have studies in humans that also show that the lining of your blood vessels gets less healthy it functions less well and we also know intuitively as humans that it's common sense to eat something from Mother Nature that provides vitamins minerals Etc whereas something like this is synthetic and contains little to probably no nutrition at all what the heck 
545,ujjIV3rwIi0,is mayonnaise made with avocado oil healthy these food manufacturers are trying to trick you they say we whisk the finest blend of oils eggs and vinegar to make the mayonnaise if avocado oil plus canola oil and soybean oil is the finest blend of oils then I'm Santa Claus and I hate to break it to you guys but I ain't Santa Claus so I think that craft and other big food manufacturers are waking up to the fact that you are smart enough to see that seed oils are garbage and they're  if you really want to you can just make your own mayonnaise whisk Tallow eggs and vinegar together and that will be way healthier than this garbage 
546,LCmUOoBqDV4,can you believe that both of these meals contain 1300 calories but they are not going to make you feel the same after you're done eating them this is half of a large Pizza Hut pizza the crust is made from processed white flour and there are tons of seed oils in the crust as well that's going to leave you hungrier and less satiated when you eat this you'll probably end up just eating the whole pizza honestly but here you've got 14 o of grass-fed ribeye steak tomatoes grilled squash grilled peppers half an avocado and a glass a fresh freezed orange juice and remember these are the same calories but when you eat this versus this you are getting so many more vitamins and minerals that are going to support energy libido Vitality mental Clarity and I know that you'll be less hungry when you eat this meal versus this and if you're wondering about cost the whole pizza costs $22 and this entire meal cost $17 because I've got a really nice grass-fed ribeye there go for this

549,GshOUKdb9P0,I used to use a Britt water filter to get my water and then I realized they're not really that good at all in fact they're pretty horrible a recent study showed that a Britt water filter only gets out 12 and 14% of lead and arsenic those are heavy metals out of your water and it increased the amount of aluminum in your water that's not good aluminum is associated with dementia in population studies furthermore BR water filters don't get out fluoride a substance that's been associated with lower IQs and Kids when kids drink water with fluoride in it they don't get out fr ever chemicals pfas they don't get out microplastics if you really want to filter your water and you should do that for Better Health use a reverse osmosis filter with sea salt to remineralize the water that system is more expensive than a Britt of pitcher yes but your health is the best long-term investment that you could ever make and you will definitely be healthier drinking reverse osmosis water with sea salt than getting water from this 
550,AH6pYoKBUxs,this is how I shop for butter the first thing I look for is raw butter this grocery store has raw butter that is unheated not pasteurized butter if you can't get raw butter where you are look for grass-fed organic butter grass-fed means the cows are only eating grass and organic means they're not coming in contact with anything is sprayed with pesticides couple of options here this one says pasture raised cows might not be entirely grass-fed but it is organic this one says truly grass-fed imported from Ireland this one is not certified organic but I've got a feeling it's pretty good raw is my favorite but these are my second choices and then if you want to cook with your butter and you're worried about it smoking you can use ghee which is a clarified butter that has had the milk solids removed

552,pntOg2TbaM0,what is this pour right on top chicken nuggets dump the whole bed fries Tater to American cheese so some people are going to say who do you make this for well I make this for children that is why our kids are fat sick and unhealthy that is why your kid has behavioral problems that is why adults are diabetic and fat this is crazy and the part that gets me the most here is that she says people are going to say um Miss Lady this is really unhealthy well then just eat a smaller slice we know from metabolic W studies that these processed foods make you hungrier they make your kids hungrier they're designed to make you hungry to crave more of them and adults who eat this kind of thing are not going to be able to eat less of it we know very clearly that food restriction calorie restriction fails longterm for weight loss yes you can lose weight short-term eating less of anything but longterm caloric restriction fails food portioning fails very clearly the best way to lose weight long term is to eat higher quality food 
553,0k7hotNMGVI,did you know that until 1990 McDonald's used to cook their french fries in beef Tallow but since then the french fries have 19 ingredients and they cook them in four different types of seed oils so here's the story Phil soof was a very wealthy American businessman who had a heart attack in the 1960s he was convinced like many people were at that time in history that saturated fats from animals were to blame for his heart attack and he used his resources to mount a smear campaign against saturated animal fats and McDonald's french fries eventually McDonald's caved under the pressure and switch to seed oils which contain toxic byproducts like alahh eyeses and acryline found in cigarettes when you heat them for the french fries consumers also complained and missed the beef taste from the Tallow so McDonald's now adds beef flavoring to the french fries made from wheat and Milk ingredients I wish McDonald's would just go back to cooking their french fries and Tallow so here's my challenge to McDonald's if you cook your French fries and Tallow at any location in the United States anywhere in the world I will fly there eat your French fries and do content about it I'm challenging you McDonald's cook your fries in Tallow again

555,qz0pBIa2r7g,one of the things that bugs me the most when I'm traveling is that you can almost always only get water in plastic in airports which is why I realized you can actually bring a coconut on the plane so here I've got essentially spring water plus some good coconut sugar magnes magnesium in a conveniently packaged coconut with no pfas no other  from the plastic that's leaching into your water but this kind of stuff even though it's cold in the airport you just don't know how long this has been in this plastic bottle if it's been warm if it's been in the Sun how much of the things in this plastic that are harmful for you that are disrupting your hormones are leeching into the water I if I can avoid it I'm never going to drink water in plastic especially not in airport but I'm going to bring some Coconuts on the plane 
556,YVDoVHlY-7Q,fake Health Foods this one is bad look at this Kashi cereal it's got a heart on the cover it looks like it's healthy it even says it's organic and honey toasted but look at the ingredients and you'll be surprised cane syrup expeller press canola oil natural flavors but it's okay because the canola oil is organic right no seed oils in your Kashi organic honey toasted with a heart on the cover cereal are this is not a health food again More Foods pretending to be Health Foods trying to fool you this is how seed oils and other garbage like processed sugars natural flavors artificial flavors sneak into your diet they don't create health and this is what irks me these things are pretending to be healthy but they're just garbage total

558,BX7g_cudbAM,if you're thriving why change anything but if you're not it's really interesting and insightful to question our assumptions about nutrition first assumption meat is horrible for us that's the devil that's the cause of heart disease second assumption vegetables are great for everyone plants are the best thing on the earth eat more of these to thrive if you have an illness it's cuz you're not eating enough fiber and so I turn that on its head and go okay if you look at unprocessed animal and plant foods which I think can form an incredibly healthy diet for every human there is I believe a hierarchy of value in those foods and we see this reflected in the way hunter gatherers behave the foods they prefer and if you ask Western medicine plants are at the top and I'm going to say actually let's put plants at the bottom and put meat at the top because meat and organs are the center of every human diet that we've ever studied and doesn't mean that they eat only meat in organs but if you ask the hza what's your favorite food it's meat without a question I mean Singapore has one of the longest average life expectancies and they have one of the highest consumptions of meat in the world I think it's like a pound and a half average of meat per day and that never gets mentioned in conversations about blue zones

560,TugyzhBOUBU,this is how food manufacturers trick you look at this here's a craft Mayo it says it's made with olive oil on the label that sounds healthier than seed oils right but if you look at the ingredients canola oil is the third ingredient soybean oil is the fourth ingredient and on the back here they say we whisk the olive oil eggs and vinegar to make a mayonnaise but they don't tell you they're whisking the olive oil eggs and vinegar along with soybean oil and canola oil to make a mayonnaise full of seed oils I think that many food companies like craft are starting to realize that consumers know that seed oils like canola and soybean oil are horrible for them and they're getting Savvy they're getting smart don't be fooled guys read the labels realize that manufacturers are trying to trick you 
561,0Hl3nOTIFf0,I was seeing people in Psychiatry and there was never any attention to diet and yeah you're seeing neuroinflammation that's the root cause of most psychiatric illness what's triggering that well it's something coming from here and so dietary changes in Psychiatry that's such a radical thing to do there was absolutely no ability to do that in my residency at the University of Washington one of the most preeminent universities in the country in Seattle there's no ability to treat anything with diet it's all medications don't worry about the side effects any of this stuff and so that was really why I left medicine I've had this just complete loss of religion and I'm still a doctor I'm still a board certified licensed physician but I don't practice I this sort of thing educationally and I realized that there's so many parallels between the way that we divide brain and the body and with every other autoimmune condition that we see I mean I've talked to so many people who go to see gastron neurologists for inflammatory bowel diseases Crohns and all sort of colitis who are told there's no connection with diet it's literally in your gut

564,nt-25UJ6IaE,this is how I shop for eggs there are tons of different varieties of eggs here how do you even sort through all this so start with Organic you don't want what the chickens are fed to have pesticides on it because those pesticides are going to accumulate in the eggs second thing is that free range versus past your range when an egg says free range it has a small amount of outdoor space to roam what's better than free range is pasture raise in order for an egg to be labeled pasture raise it must have a much larger amount of space to roam an average of 106 square feet of space to roam per chicken much more than a free range egg and if I can find it I look for an egg that is corn and soy free when chickens eat corn and soy they accumulate excess amounts of linolic acid that polyunsaturated acid you find in seed oils in their eggs and I think that that makes their eggs less healthy so a corn and soyf free organic pasture raised egg is about as good as you're going to be able to

566,X8y8_Ud0CTk,what do you think of this carnivore diet well first of all it's complete nonsense the problem is the saturated fats are very bad for you they clog up your coronary arteries they increase your risk of heart disease and cancer but to say that saturated fat is bad for you increases your risk of cancer this has never been conclusively shown in any randomized controlled trial in fact what has been shown is that saturated fat versus polyunsaturated fat is going to lower oxidized LDL and lower LP little a which are both very strong risk factors of coronary artery disease also we know that butter probably the quintessential saturated fat lowers CRP it lowers inflammation saturated fat from dairy has consistently been associated with Better Health outcomes there are also odd chain fatty acids which are saturated found in dairy fat C15 and c17 and those have consistently been associated with improved Health outcomes a lot of doctors are very smart and very well-intentioned but they're often very limited in their understanding of the science I look forward to a healthy friendly debate with this one

569,a49gJwAf1yo,120 years ago 130 years ago all Americans ate were animal fats and the rates of cardiovascular disease were a fraction of what they are today so anyone who wants to argue that animal fats are the cause of cardiovascular disease you got a really hard argument to make because there's a there's a natural experiment of many millions of Americans from 1900 or 1875 showing very low rates of cardiovascular disease and then something happened in 1950 with anel keys the seven country study Eisenhower had his heart attack his cardiologist was Paul Dudley White and the American Heart Association got a $1.7 million donation the equivalent of $20 million today from Proctor and Gamble who made Chrisco wow and then the American Heart Association begins talking about how saturated fats are bad highly unsaturated fats are good and there are literally advertisements from the 1960s talking about how you should polyunsaturate your family is so yes mola corn oil 
570,s0974tS6ZJ8,the CEO of Kelloggs recently told us that we should be eating cereal for dinner to save money so we're advertising about cereal for dinner if you think about the cost of cereal for a family versus what they might otherwise do that's going to be much more affordable right off the bat this box of Special K which is a pound of Special K is $468 I can walk right over there and get a pound of much more nutrient-rich ground beef for $3.99 when it comes to cost versus nutrients ground beef wins every time versus Cereal there's not really many great nutrients in here they're going to say that it's full of vitamins and minerals but you know they're adding them they're all synthetic added vitamins and minerals because let's face it a bunch of ultra processed wheat flakes are not actually that good for humans just eat some ground beef for dinner that's how you can save some money and nourish yourselves and your family you got any guesses what the CEO of Kelloggs eats for dinner pretty sure it's not Special K

572,_9ZlUlNMXwA,a study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that drinking water out of plastic bottles could significantly increase your risk of a heart attack in this study researchers looked for microplastics in the plaque in these patients necks called cored plaques and they found that the patients who had the most microplastics in their neck arteries had a four and a half times increased risk of cardiovascular disease a study looking at the actual amounts of microplastic consumption from Newcastle Australia suggests that drinking bottled water water and plastic could lead to the equivalent of 5 G of microplastics per week that's potentially a credit card's worth of plastic going into your body every week the biggest sources are your drinking water especially water in plastic water bottles none of us are going to have an easy time of completely eliminating our exposure to microplastics in our lives but if you stop drinking water from plastic bottles this will significantly reduce your and your family's exposure microplastics are not something we can ignore anymore they're a significant contributor to poor heal

576,MfpXxrRNZ5Y,eating this is like smoking a pack of these a recent study found that the amount of toxic chemicals like acryline and alides in a large fry at McDonald's is equivalent to what you get from smoking 25 cigarettes this is because the oils used in the frying of these french fries seed oils like canola and soybean are unstable when you heat them and they sit in the McDonald's fryers and that produces toxic chemicals acryline Alpha Beta unsaturated aldah all these chemicals are associated with cancer just like this if you want to eat french fries cook them in Tallow the same study also explains that saturated fats like those dominant in animal fats do not oxidize do not create the same toxic byproducts when you eat them so the next time you go to eat McDonald's french fries or french fries from any of your favorite fast food place think about the fact that you're basically smoking a pack of cigarettes

586,HRO1us-xI3E,there is a new study out there that's talking about how eating too much red meat is strongly associated with developing type 2 diabetes what they found is even less than one serving a day on average was associated with an increased risk but the good news is if you ate just a half a serving a day of nuts and legumes you could lower that risk by as much as 30% if not more just not have your steak and eat some nuts there we go there you go first of all there's no mechanism by which red meat can cause diabetes but red meat always gets blamed red meat is the scapegoat it will always be the scapegoat it always gets blamed but it is just not the culprit that meat is an incredibly nutrient rich food for humans it's never been shown to be inflammatory for humans in unprocessed forms but still we get studies published like this from Harvard showing that red meat is consistently associated with diabetes it's really embarrassing and it's silly what this study shows us is that people who eat red meat in the general American population tend to have other unhealthy behaviors and it's very likely those unhealthy behaviors that we see leading them to have more diabetes not the red meat 
587,dOnDM5NpECs,"both of these meals contain 1,600 calories this cost me $23 this cost me $115.50 but you are going to be much more full for longer with better energy if you eat unprocessed foods like this versus Five Guys I've got a burger from Five Guys fortunately 100% beef but there's definitely seed oils in the Mayo in here and the milkshake here contains 82 G of processed sugar that's the equivalent of 23 sugar packets over here we've got two grass-fed beef burgers you got 3 oz of raw cheese a sweet potato half an avocado grilled peppers and squash fresh squeezed orange juice another orange for good measure and kiwi we know very clearly that when you eat Ultra processed foods like this you are going to be hungrier sooner and overeat leading to weight gain and when you eat whole animal and plant foods like this you are going to be less hungry and you will have an easier time losing weight you will feel better and be healthier long term even though both of these meals are, 1600 calories it's no question which is better for you in the long run I'm choosing this "
588,mDpL3iHtaw8,even plant-based Burgers know that there's something up with plant-based food you can get Beyond burgers at Sam's Club and I find it hilarious that on this plant-based patties these plant-based Burgers they advertise there's no soy and no gluten so even within the plant-based movement they realize that soy and gluten are total [Â __Â ] but wait a minute how many other plant-based foods are made with soy and gluten a ton it's hilarious to me that even within the plant-based movement even with a vegan food they're starting to infight and say well our vegan foods don't have soy because we all know this is harmful for us really humans should just be eating real meat that's where the nutrients are this is just a sign of things to come and I think the complete collapse of these plant-based Foods because nobody wants to eat this stuff anyway 
589,H_Y-3hPsVfc,this is the McDonald's play pen this is actually a pretty freaking amazing playground but it's in McDonald's you think that anytime a kid drives by McDonald's in the car with their parents they're not going to say Mom Dad I want to go to the play place of McDonald's and when they get in here they're not going to say can I get a Happy Meal can I get french fries can I get chicken nuggets that you know are cooked in seed oils that are full of harmful things preservatives poly sorb 80 high fructose corn syrup this is clearly here to trick you and your kids to get them addict to junk food at places like McDonald's this is a great freaking playground I love the idea of getting kids to actually move but doing it here is Sinister shame on you McDonald's 
590,vqY6QyV_IlI,here are three reasons you should eat more red meat red meat and organs are some of the most nutrient-dense Foods on the planet eating red meat foods like liver and heart will simply improve the quality of your life your energy your sleep your libido because of the unique micronutrients they contain that are difficult to find other Foods especially in plant Foods red meat and organs contain some of the most bioavailable protein on the planet far more bioavailable than plant Foods more bioavailable protein means more muscle mass higher metabolism stronger joints and ligaments which leads to increase resilience from injury faster recovery and finally grass-feeding grass finishing cattle like is done on this regenerative farm and Australia is carbon negative it improves the quality of the soil and sequesters more carbon into the soil than is created in the production of the meat from these animals regenerative agriculture is part of the solution to the environmental issues we have on this planet now by regenerating the land and being carbon negative this is why you should eat more meat and organs 
591,22HuFL6CgnU,if you're buying diapers for your child know what's in them I would look for something that's free from fragrance which is going to be phalates and other xenoestrogen hormone disrupting compounds chlorine bleaches parabens which are also fragrances and latex if you want to buy a diaper know what's in it and get something that's free of all those things because if you have xenoestrogens if you have hormone disrupting compounds in your child's diaper that's going to be absorbed by your child as they're developing in childhood that's not a good thing so what we put on our child's skin what we put on our skin and the clothes we wear this gets into our bodies know it's going in your child's skin 
592,b3rUWH3-2RU,Marilyn Monroe ate a breakfast of milk with raw eggs every morning and ate liver for dinner Angelina Jolie has said that steak is her beauty secret and that a vegan diet nearly killed her because she wasn't getting enough nutrition listen this is simple if you want to be beautiful if you want to be handsome if you want to thrive you eat steak include animal products in your diet include raw milk include eggs include liver include steak that is how you thrive plain and simple listen to Angelina Jolie and Marilyn Monroe I need to go find some steak 
593,AYYIth4Lehc,you ask me what I think about chicken here's the deal chicken is meat it's an animal doesn't contain defense chemicals I think it's much better than eating a ton of plant Foods processed plant Foods or Garbage processed foods but when it comes to chicken versus red meat I'm much more a fan of beef and bison than I am of chicken because even the best chickens organic chickens are going to be fed corn and soil they're going to be fed grains they're going to be fed foods that are not evolutionarily appropriate for the chickens I think that the way for humans to thrive is to make the majority of your diet red meat beef grass-fed beef beef bison things like this lamb venison if you want to eat chicken occasionally that's great but it's very hard to find chicken that's actually fed what chickens are supposed to eat 
594,AM5vtp8_be8,I don't drink coffee but if I did here's how I would do it I would start with a good organic coffee I would only brew that coffee with spring water or reverse osmosis water I would not brew the coffee in a coffee pot like this because of all the condensation in here from the hot water that could lead to leeching of components from the plastic hormone disrupting components from the plastic into your coffee what I would use instead is something like a French press or a pourover style for the coffee I would wait 90 minutes after I woke up to drink the coffee and not drink the coffee after 12:00 p.m. if I were going to have cream or milk I would use a raw cream or milk if I were going to have sugar I would use a raw honey and if I were drinking coffee during the day I would be sure to replenish minerals that will be lost from the caffeine that you're drinking with the coffee getting plenty of good things like a natural sea salt coconut water or orange juice other fruit juices to replenish the minerals that are lost 
595,tvWdsPxS84c,this is what I use for shampoo and soap come in my shower as you can see there's nothing here I don't use shampoo I don't use soap I just shower in water why do I do this so many shampoos and soaps are full of phalates parabens fragrances these are hormone disrupting chemicals I don't want to smell like a shampoo or a fake chemical scent in a soap I just want to smell like a human don't smell I promise you guys if you have a bad odor it's probably because of something going on with your gut what you're eating fix those things and you'll be healthier and you will smell less bad this will blow your mind you can just get the dirt off your skin by using water now I know that some of you may use lotions or other oil based things or makeups and in that case there are natural ways to get these off your skin like apple cider vinegar if you really need to there are companies that make good Tallow based soaps and even some Tallow based shampoos look for the smallest number of ingredients no phalates no parabens no other garbage in there for sure 
596,W_vKL3_nyTE,seed oils and ice cream that is crazy butter pean ice cream man I used to love this when I was a kid cotton seed oil is the fifth ingredient in there do we even wonder why our kids are getting fat sick and unhealthy and as adults we are generally anxious depressed and not living our best lives it's just because these garbage ingredients are infiltrating so many of our Foods read the labels get these seed oils out of your diet completely 
597,hNjuesC7x7A,it's really clear that there's something going on with these non-nutritive sweeteners I have seen so many cases of people who are trying to lose weight drinking six Diet Cokes a day they're saying look I'm getting zero calories in here and nothing will budge substitute soda water for the diet coke for a month and the world changes W I think Peter is right here and it speaks to the value of clinical judgment even sometimes when that clinical judgment has not had full randomized control trials to support it certainly there is some literature in animal models to suggest that these artificial sweeteners affect the gut Flora in negative ways and there's some preliminary research in humans suggesting that sucrose when consumed with carbohydrates will affect insulin signaling on the flip side there are metaanalyses of artificial sweeteners in drinks suggesting that they are neutral or even potentially positive for weight loss these are sweeteners that we would never have been exposed to evolutionarily as humans there's no nutritional value to these I think you will be healthier without them 
598,tZ9tYFDjeig,seed oils in your Healthy sunscreen many of these healthy alternative sunscreens contain seed oils just like you don't want to eat seed oils you do not want to put seed oils on your skin because that seed oil is then going to go into your skin into your dermis and epidermis and accumulate in your cell membranes there making them fragile so that when they come in contact with the sun they get damaged making your own sunscreen or looking for a Tallow based sunscreen is probably the best option out there because a lot of these healthy alternative sunscreens are actually not that great I would never put them on my body and I would never recommend them you guys to put them on your skin when you're in the Sun for protection use something better use a tall based sunscreen or make your own

600,TJtY8-5h_pY,men who consume the most cheese have the lowest sperm counts and the worst motility morphology when you eat cheese you're eating something that's three4 fat you're gaining body weight I can reduce your testosterone level just by putting you on a Cheesy meaty diet because there's estrogen in the dairy itself an animal-based diet is just a recipe for hormone hay completely false there's a 2020 meta analysis which shows that low fat diets are in fact associated with lower amounts of testosterone in men there are Interventional studies in men showing that higher fat lower fiber diets lead to increases in testosterone in 6 to 18 year olds increased consumption of dairy was associated with a significantly higher probability of a lean body mass phenotype and in women trying to lose weight increased consumption of high protein higher Dairy diets led to more lean mass and less fat cheese also contains vitamin K2 which has been shown to decrease estrogen binding cheese contains CLA which increases testosterone and 
601,Du9aNuJTWyE,Farm ra salmon is colored if you look at the ingredients on farm raay salmon it's going to say salmon and then it's going to say some sort of a colorant farm- raised salmon is anything that says Atlantic salmon but doesn't say wild caught or wild raised these salmon are raised on farms they're fed horable food they're fed grains they're fed fish food which is full of things like paroro alalal compounds pfas which are also known as forever chemicals hormone disruptors it's full of BPA pcbs which are polychlorinated by fennels it's full of microplastics and all of those things get concentrated in an unhealthy fish rais in a pen eating garbage food eating basically the fish equivalent of processed food and the Flesh of that salmon is white but they add a dye to convince you to trick you into thinking that it's something like a wild salmon so when it comes to fish be careful a lot of fish is very high in heavy metals look for fish that is low in heavy metals and preferably not farm raised interestingly there are a couple of farm raised fish operations like copia that are trying to do this better they're actually testing their farm raised fish for BPA pfas heavy metals and you can do farm rais fish better if you're careful about what you feed the fish 
602,Z3zT8KN6dtg,here's my Sprouts grocery haul guys hot take Sprouts crushes Whole Foods way better than Whole Foods look at this I got bison and beef patties from force of nature Venison and beef patties from force of nature I got grass-fed beef liver at Sprouts I got raw cir I got raw goats milk cheddar raw grapes raw grapes organic grapes organic mandarins organic bimmons organic avocados organic pomegranate it's going to make some juice out of that and some organic grapefruit organs meat fruit the only thing I'm missing here is honey I can go grab some of that raw dairy sprouts good grocery holiday guys pretty easy 
603,WpRIxx5XRd8,this potentially cancer-causing chemical is probably on most of the food in your house right now glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the United States today and it is sprayed on so many of the foods we eat it's probably in your house right now in 2015 the international Agency on the research of cancer classified glyphosate as a group 2A carcinogen stating that it was probably carcinogenic cancer causing in humans and connecting it to Non-Hodgkins lymphoma so what's the answer here choose organic non-GMO food when you can with things like honey make sure that it's certified glyphosate free if you're eating meat opt for grass-fed grass-finished regeneratively raised beef preferably from small local farms and Farmers that you know those changes aren't always easy but doing those things will almost entirely reduce your exposure to glyphosate in your diet 
604,KMTbFAz3deA,How can there be 10 ingredients in pickles at McDonald's McDonald's pickles contain potassium sorbate a preservative with concerns that it will damage DNA genotoxicity and carcinogenicity that's cancer causing they also contain polysorbate 80 a thickening agent that has been studied in animal models and found there to cause damage to the intestinal lining that is leaky gut and decreased microbial diversity of the microbiome so that's not great these pickles also contain aluminum salts we know very clearly that increased amounts of aluminum in the human diet are associated with increased rates of dementia like Alzheimer the fact that there are 10 ingredients in these pickles is crazy it's made even worse by the fact that over 60% of our diet is ultr processed foods in the US and these things are harming us eating processed foods is a swift path to being fat to being unhealthy eventually to diabetes and other chronic disease if you truly want to thrive Eat Real Foods eat meat and make your own pickles just take a cucumber and put it in some salt and vinegar that'll be way better than this thing 
605,kI2XPqhqVHg,this liver contains more nutrients than kale you've been told that kale is a superfood and yeah this is better than an ultra processed food but my money is on liver and red meat when it comes to True superfoods just look at this chart look at the nutrients in liver versus the nutrients in kale in terms of nutrient density there's no comparison between what you get in liver and what you get in kale and there are so many nutrients found in animal foods like red meat and liver that simply don't occur in plant foods like kale one of the ultimate plant superfoods things like creatine carnitine ancine torine vitamin B12 vitamin K2 significant amounts of choline the list goes on and on we also know that protein and animal Foods is much more bioavailable than protein and plant Foods if we're talking Super Foods my money is right here on liver not this 
606,batuBQZ8klw,this is a jet lag hack grounding in connection with sunlight to reset the Circadian rhythm grounding in a particular place is connected with the Circadian rhythm so if you're traveling definitely put your feet on the grass 15 to 20 minutes get in the water a lake or an ocean I think that'll definitely help reset the sucan Rhythm along with the grounding of the earth pretty wild stuff

617,xittdCv-hvs,there's so much conflicting health information today there's another guy or girl saying Kale's the best thing on the Earth it's a bean diet spinach is amazing and celery juicing right and I'm going to say oh spinach is full of oxalates so if you've got issues maybe you know what I want people to think about or what I would suggest they think about is just how do you get the most nutrients with the least amount of toxins and then understand what your Baseline is so you can feel as good as possible and then navigate yourself because there's definitely bio-individuality and differences between humans in terms of what foods are really going to allow us to feel the best but that's the goal for humans to thrive yeah

620,bCZa3pPzv1M,processed foods are making you fat Ultra processed foods at places like McDonald's these foods are highly correlated with obesity here's a chart showing the highest rates of obesity that's being fat in the United States here's another chart showing the highest rates of ultr processed fast food consumption like McDonald's you see anything going on there those charts are almost exactly the same places in the United States where people eat the most Ultra processed foods are the places where people are the fattest is this any coincidence I doubt it Ultra processed foods make up more than 60 that's 60% of the American diet is it any wonder that we're all getting fatter sicker and unhealthier that obesity rates are climbing the diabetes rates are climbing that fertility is at an all-time low these are scary things and I believe they are strongly directly related to the excess consumption of these ultr processed foods if you want to be healthier step number one is so simple stop doing this stop eating Ultra processed foods you will be healthier there's no question about that end of story 
621,9inc4BTjYAc,magnesium deficiency can contribute to poor sleep and magnesium deficiency is extremely common with over 56% of the world's population known to be deficient in magnesium how do you get enough magnesium in your diet on an animal- based diet this is how I do it milk is a great source forh squeezed orange juice meat is an amazing source of bioavailable magnesium heart and coconut water the time in my life when I had the most profound magnesium deficiency was when I was a raw vegan despite eating tons of leafy greens and tons of almonds foods that you are told are great sources of magnesium ium specifically magnesium in nuts or leafy greens is often bound up in things like phytic acid or can be bound by oxalates making it very poorly bioavailable so if you have issues sleeping or you just want to optimize the more than 300 biochemical reactions in your body that need magnesium and you want to be optimally healthy focus on getting the foods with bioavailable magnesium if you truly want to thrive

623,cet7iqK8tZo,this is the biggest secret at Sprouts Farmers Market that you don't know about this is a raw cafir from raw Farm in California I've been to this farm and they can sell this as a pet food it says it's a raw probiotic for dogs and cats but here's the secret this is the exact same raw milk cafir that is for humans this is human quality cafir mark it as a pet food so that they can get it to you in Sprouts all over the United States raw milk raw dairy raw cafir these are illegal to sell directly to consumers in grocery stores like this across the United States despite the fact that this is a super safe farm and it's are very valuable things for human gut health so in order to get this into the grocery store it's marketed as a pet food but it's not pet food this is human cafir it's super healthy for you cheers 
624,rkFASSeIQZ0,this nutrient is critical for heart health and it's nearly impossible to find in plant Foods I'm talking about vitamin K2 and liver is one of the best sources of vitamin K2 on the planet in population studies like the rdam study those who ate the highest amount of vitamin K2 from animal Foods things like meat eggs liver had the lowest rates of cardiovascular disease and yet I believe that the majority of us are not getting enough vitamin K2 every day we're told to eat less meat less red meat less eggs all these things and yet these are the best sources of this critical vitamin for the health of your heart unless you're eating Nat which is fermented soybeans and looks kind of gross you're not getting any vitamin K2 from plant Foods so to improve the health of your heart don't fear red meat don't fear liver don't fear egg yolks these are Health Foods 
625,KPv79qt1I1c,this is how to get more organs in your diet I got a grassfed grass finish regeneratively raised chuck steak here not good for grilling but really good for ground beef that goes into the grinder then I'm going to add some heart and some liver that is going to make the best hamburger ever how cool is that an easy way for me to make my own Primal ground beef these cuts are not going to be great steaks but the nutrition in there with the Harden liver challenge you to find anything better than that that's amazing 
626,lqfeDmtppJA,every nutrient that we know of for humans to thrive is in animal Foods is in meat and liver but where are the plant foods that contain vitamin K2 that contain creatine torine anine and carnitine and carnosine and for hydroxyproline which is a component of collagen those specific nutrients are all studied in beneficial for longevity and all of the nutrients I mentioned vitamin B12 vitamin K2 the list goes on and on are only found in animal Foods in any significant amount 
627,LSY3J49Qpo4,you've got a PokÃ©mon Happy Meal here and you get PokÃ©mon cards with your diabetes obesity depression and bad behavior inducing junk food I ate Happy Meals when I was a kid but let's see what's in here french fries 19 ingredients four different types of seed oils aluminum preservatives Silly Putty ingredients apple slices well at least that's okay hamburger the bun contains seed oils and processed sugars the pickles at McDonald's contain 10 ingredients thankfully most of the burgers at McDonald's are 100% beef so that's the least problematic part of this your milk which has sugar liquid sugar and kagenin but this is really sad guys in children over 67% of calories are for Ultra processed foods from a financial perspective Happy Meals don't make any sense either for $538 I can basically buy a pound of grass-fed ground beef and make my kid five grass-fed burgers without processed sugars high fructose corn seere multiple seed oils kagene and free from all of the propaganda that comes with this Happy Meal that in my opinion is a much better choice than this for your kids 
628,RoifQibJXuY,you are what you eat here are my thoughts for starters directed by a vegan the primary investigator in the study is a vegan who also is the head of the Stanford plant-based initiative which is funded by beyond meat vegan propaganda you can make an argument that it might have some conflicts of interests perhaps so what did the study actually find the vegan twins lost more weight than the omnivore twins but if you dig more into what actually happened you see that the researchers provided the vegan twins with less calories well that will result in more weight loss and in the examples of dexus scans shown in the documentary the vegan twins lost significantly more muscle mass than the omnivores in many cases resulting in a higher body fat percentage at the end of the study what is presented is the notion that the vegans lost more weight and because of that weight loss they had an improvement in insulin sensitivity but we also know that you can give someone a reduced calorie diet of anything including Twinkies which has been done and that results in Improvement in insulin sensitivity so this is my concern is that this is misleading people and harming them in the long run 
629,QaIvsqqaRSo,broccoli is I say this in some of my short form content and I recently just got called out for saying there's not randomized controlled trials in humans to say that broccoli is harmful but here's my take actually don't think you need randomized control trials in humans when you have significant clinical experience I've seen hundreds if not thousands of people improve gut issues skin issues thyroid issues from cutting out broccoli kale other cruciferous plants from their diet these plants contain compounds that can inhibit the absorption of iodine at the level of the thyroid and in animal models like in pigs who have that are pretty darn similar to humans giving raw broccoli to them causes increased DNA breaks which sounds like it could be damaging the gut of those pigs as I tried to say in my content over and over if you're thriving why change anything about your diet but I make this content for people who are continuing to suffer in the hope that they will find improved Health from these ideas that I've seen benefit so many people in my clinical practice and online I appreciate the criticism and I look forward to Future discussions like this and I hope that this content will be beneficial to a lot of you out there who may continue to struggle with health issues and aren't finding answers elsewhere

637,cFwRl-wwiHE,could eating red meat help you live longer a recent study published in the journal science suggests this is a distinct possibility researchers in this study we're looking at a unique amino acid called torine this amino acid occurs only in meat researchers noticed that in aging across multiple species torine levels declined so they decided to give toine to mice lo and behold the mice lived longer and they were healthier they also found that when they gave torine to monkeys the monkeys were healthier longer Interventional studies with torine and humans improved exercise performance decreased muscle cramping Improvement in cardiac function in patients with congestive heart failure decreased blood pressure and decreased atherogenic indices it's really hard to study a compound for longevity but I think the majority of the evidence across species and in humans suggests that torine improves our health do not fear red meat this is a health food and contains so many nutrients like torine that are difficult to find in other places and are clearly connected with improved Health in humans

658,wUs0yVAH2d8,James Cameron the director of Avatar and Terminator thinks testosterone is toxic for men I guess it's not surprising that he's made $140 million investment into a plant-based PE protein company so when you look at all of the plant-based proteins here so many of them contain P protein concentrate P protein P protein P protein P protein if you think testosterone is toxic for men you might not want to eat animal foods like meat and organs which we know clearly support the formation of test testosterone healthy sex drive in libbido in both men and women and you might want to eat things like PE protein or avoiding saturated fats from animals which we know are also associated with increased levels of testosterone so I can't believe James Cameron would say the testosterone is toxic for men but it makes sense that if you think that way that you would try and get people to eat plant-based and make a huge investment in a company that makes pea protein which is all of this James Cameron testosterone killing plant-based protein right here for you 
659,YqKG9GYQ6BA,the first thing I wanted to know was what actually went into the burger me too here what we have in front of me is all of those natural plant ingredients yeah what fat does is it props good flavor and then is it delivery system sunflower oil is a unsaturated fat so a lot of people say it's the good fats seed oils are the good fats I would disagree with this here there's a lot of evidence to suggest that these seed oils which are in this impossible Burger increase oxidized LDL LP littlea LP2 which means they increase your risk of cardiovascular disease these fats accumulate in cell membranes and essentially lead to the majority of chronic disease in humans over the last 100 years so things like obesity diabetes dementia I believe this is strongly driven by these seed oils The Narrative has been Twisted I've strongly believe that meat is what humans need to thrive which is full of incredible nutrients that are not found in plant-based Burgers impossible Burgers not so good for human health

662,rTqQN1Yja00,if you take fish oil you need to hear this I think Omega-3s are a valuable part of the human diet but I think there are better ways to get them than fish oils many fish oils including top selling brands contain significant levels of oxidized lipids meaning that the fish oil is spoiled or rancid this creates harmful products or negative chemical reactions in your body especially if you're getting burps that taste like fish that's a good indication that your fish oil is ranid also if you think you need massive amounts of Omega-3 in your diet for cardiac protection consider this analysis of multiple trials with omega-3 supplementation of high doses showing a significant signal toward increased atrial fibrillation cardiac arhythmia with 4 gr or more of fish oil per day that is way too much fish oil in my opinion and I would not be eating fish oil in the first place where should you get your Omega-3s pasture raised egg yolks animal fats like butter Tallow or ghee and the fat in your steak especially if it's grass-fed all of these contain significant amounts of omega-3 fatty acids that can be utilized by humans

674,spZ6hsjuKnY,this is my nighttime routine it starts with me watching the sunset outside with bare feet connected to the ground then I eat some dinner usually try to finish dinner a few hours before I'm going to sleep if I'm doing any work after dark I'll take the blue light out of my screen on my computer and my phone and I'll unplug the Wi-Fi to my house no emfs while I'm sleeping inside I'll turn on red lights turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on my phone and listen to theta waves while I put my feet up on the wall to relax at the end of a day and let my brain quiet put some earplugs in and I'm off to sleep that's how I end my day 
675,ZnS8VH8K-oY,there are essentially construction dust iron filings added to weedies you could use a magnet to pull out the iron filings in weedies and other cereals and I did it I took this box of weedies I put it in a blender I blended it up I added water to it to make this weedies mush let it sit for about 20 minutes and then I used my magnet and all that black stuff right there that is literally iron filings literal construction material they have a long list of vitamins and minerals on the side of the Box tricking you into the thinking that this is a health food not so fast synthetic vitamins and minerals on the side of a weedies box when these are added to Foods they're not as bioavailable they're often in inorganic forms like the iron is in this box of wheedies as opposed to things like heem iron which is in meat or organs like liver or heart much more bioavailable much easier for the body to incorporate because that's what we've been doing for millions of years of human evolution 
676,sHHYWArS5Us,your McDonald's chicken nuggets contain 30 ingredients I used to love these as a kid too I ate too many of them now that I know what's in them it's kind of scary I think part of the reason that I was kind of a fat kid is because my parents let me eat way too much junk food like this there are four different types of seed oils corn oil canola oil soybean oil and hydrogenated soybean oil there is chicken in here but there's also bleached white flour which can be bleached with harmful chemicals like chlorine dioxide or benzo dioxide there's also multiple preservatives in chicken nuggets including aluminum phosphate excess amounts ofum in the human diet have been associated with increased rates of dementia and Alzheimer's disease that's not even talking about the sauces sweet and sour sauce first ingredient high fructose corn syrup also contains soybean oil ranch sauce first ingredient soybean oil do not eat chicken nuggets do not let your children eat chicken nuggets as Americans we get more than 60% of our calories as Ultra processed foods like this it's no wonder that so many of us are fat sick and unhealthy The Way Forward is clear eating less ultr processed food more unprocessed nutrient-rich Foods 
677,H3B8UVdlaQQ,this is how I order at restaurants you can look at a menu at a steakhouse most of the steaks if you ask them are not cooked in seed ears I'm going to ask the waiter if they're cooking in seed oils but I don't think they are oysters are also super safe I probably will avoid most of the sauces not going to drink with tap water you can get bottled water at a rest this is how you order I would like the grass-fed ribey 14 oz I didn't medium rare and the 8 oz fet minan medium rare can you tell me how the steaks are cooked I just want to make sure there are no seed oils touching the than no seed just put it in a kind of Tallow pure Tallow and then we are going to season it with salt sear and oil awesome thank you so here's the steak definitely not going to eat a tomato with parsley I'm not going to put any steak sauce on there they just did steak with salt cooked in Tallow no seed oils and I even asked them about the mushrooms there's no seed oils in the mushrooms just butter wine or solid reduction I generally don't need a lot of fungus lot of mushrooms but with mushrooms it's probably pretty benign this is how I eat at restaurants easy 
678,brzQVOWPjfQ,I ate a lot of meat a lot of bone broth a lot of organs I had such great pregnancies I think that was a big part of it I don't doubt it I mean this is so evolutionarily consistent if you go to cultures around the world this is what they do you know I went to Tanzania I spent time with the hza some of the last 100 gatherers left on the planet when a woman's pregnant or wants to get pregnant they feed them organs and meat we've known this this is human wisdom that's been forgotten and it's especially like you said especially for women it's been kind of programmed out of us something intuitively told me to eat the liver so I ate it and I had was bouncing off the walls 
679,-TqUmZjq_fA,here's why you should eat more fermented foods look I'm a fan of these you got pickles in here you've got sauerkraut down here with just cabbage water and salt in there you've got cfir here these are all fermented foods we know that fermented foods raise the diversity of your gut Flora we call this Alpha diversity in studies fermented foods raise the alpha diversity and that's usually going to be beneficial for your gut fiber doesn't raise the alpha diversity fermented foods raise the alha diversity sauerkraut when you ferment the Cabbage it gets rid of most of the anti-nutrients pickles especially when they're fermented properly pickles are great cfir very beneficial for your gut all of these will increase the op of diversity but getting more fermented foods probably a good thing for most humans especially if you have gut issues 
680,mXBW98oWfcA,there are 800 gallons of truly raw milk fermenting in this stainless steel vat to make raw cafir it's one of my favorite foods on the planet raw dairy especially raw fermented dairy like raw cafir has been shown repeatedly to be beneficial for the human gut this is food as medicine and it is incredible to see it being made here raw milk is brought into the factory gently warmed to 76Â° and fermented until the pH drops to around 3.8 this cafir will be ready tomorrow if you have gut issues including raw dairy in the form of raw milk raw cafir raw butter or raw cheese in your diet will definitely improve those 
681,qxjfTWRLyHk,this farm raay salmon is actually this color but they add color to it to make it look like wild salmon which it is nothing like farm rais salmon is raised in underwater pens it's fed GMO corn GMO soy poo and medications to prevent overgrowth of bacterial infections because it's so unhealthy all fish is going to accumulate some heavy metals which is not a good thing but wild salmon is a much better choice than any Atlantic salmon all Atlantic salmon is going to be farm raised and we know that these chemical pcbs pbdes are endocrine disruptors yes it's an animal food it's not a plant food but this is one of my least favorite 
682,psjDahfNkXs,this is how plant-based ground beef is made you take some soy protein concentrate sunflower oil soy leg hemoglobin then you add some methyl cellulose which is basically sawdust and this is how real ground beef is made I've got some grass bed brass finish regeneratively raised beef from a cow that I actually helped with the slaughter of take a grinder and out comes real fresh ground beef full of nutrients bioavailable vitamins and minerals no garbage no seed oils no soy leg hemoglobin no soy protein concentrate that is just nutrient-dense food for humans that's how real ground beef is made which is more appetizing to you eat real meat and thrive 
683,fxgw7hYAuzk,the vast major majority of food contributing to our emission crisis lies in meat and dairy products we already know that a plant plant power diet is better for your physical and mental health and I am living proof of that but the reality is it is better for the planet what to say that a plant- power diet is better for your health is just a complete misunderstanding there are so many nutrients that occur in animal meat and organs that are not found in plants and to say that is better for greenhouse gas emissions is also false because plants represent more of the greenhouse gas emissions then animals and especially than ruminant animals like cows greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural livestock total 3.7% contribution of which 1.9% is from cattle and across all livestock 86% of what is fed to animals is not fit for human consumption meat is healthy for humans end of story 
684,dj89t8gj5rw,is the beef at Subway real beef are the meatballs pure meat let's go find out the meatball marinara are those meatballs like all those are pure meat is there anything in them except I think so yeah Subway is a restaurant that advertises itself as healthy fast food so I wanted to know what was in a meatball sub this is one of my favorite Subs growing up you would think that these beef meatballs would be potentially all meat but you would be wrong the meatballs contain textured soy protein and soy protein the meatballs also contain seed oils they contain soybean oil is it any Wonder guys that so many of our youth so many people looking for fast healthy options are still not able to lose weight are unhealthy are sick this to me is just criminal as humans we need to have access to good quality unprocessed nutrient-rich food that is not adulterated with a bunch of stuff like this 
685,EqZwsk-ewaw,so I went to medical school not once was nutrition discussed and not once were we challenged as Physicians or physicians in training to think what is the root cause of my patient issue it's just and this is important too we need to know this as as doctors this is the drug that I give in this situation so we know we have knee-jerk reactions you got eczema I know the drug for you you got psoriasis I know the drug you got ashimoto thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis I got the drugs for you but we never think wait a minute why do you have eczema what's caus why do you have depression why does anyone have anxiety right and that is where that's that's where I think I went left when a lot of my colleagues went right that's the question I think we need to be asking 
686,7MqjC_jK_3Q,honey is a health food I love having local raw honey in my life and my diet so much that I got my own little Hive I used to think honey was just sugar but then I looked at this medical literature there's very interesting evidence that honey improves testosterone in men lowers estrogen and honey has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in diabetics I think that honey can be a healthy part of an animal- based diet based around meat and organs with fruit and raw dairy don't fear this but look for Organic Raw and locally produced preferably free of glyphosate 
687,i9lk6qwHfQs,this is how you open a young coconut in Costa Rica first way super simple there are three little eyes on top the biggest eye is soft you can take a metal straw push it right in there and you've got a coconut to drink you hold that for me thanks second way you turn the coconut over it's got a little belly button down there take the blunt side of a knife crack it open and you do it like this and you've got a cup that's how you open a coconut 
688,ln0dMwo7NbM,this is why you should eat your steak medium rare there are many nutrients in steak but some of these are actually denatured by heat especially things like torine and some of your other B vitamins so you don't want to make your steak well done because you can denature some of the good compounds in there partially aside from the fact that a medium or a medium rare steak is much more delicious than a well done steak you're going to be getting more of the nutrients out of your steak if you don't overcook it so make sure to leave a little bit of red in the middle of your steak and eat it medium rare 
689,kjVia978VyQ,look at this you guys it looks like a piece of coyote poo or something but it's a Tamarind it's a fruit that grows in Costa R Thailand other places in the world crack the outer shell consumption of Tamarind has actually been shown to increase excretion of fluoride the chemical found in your drinking water in toothpaste all kinds of stuff that accumulates in your bones your kidneys your pineal gland look it even looks more like like a poop right now but it tastes pretty good there's like little seeds in here that I'll spit out but I mean I would eat things that look like poo if it helped me get rid of fluoride that I've been accumulating my whole life I don't use toothpaste with fluoride I don't even use toothpaste at all right now I definitely don't drink water with fluoride but if you've been drinking fluoridated water or using garbage toothpaste your whole life Tamarind it's actually pretty cool 
690,p5P7zfyyzno,here's the Twisted truth about Skittles do you have any idea why manufacturers want to make candies and all sorts of different colors like this it's very appealing to our eyes isn't it cuz manufacturers are trying to play to the fact that your body your eyes and your brain have been seeking colorful ripe fruit for hundreds of thousands of years so you may have a sweet tooth and that's okay because your ancestors involved eating fruit but to quell your sweet tooth don't get tricked into eating fake fruit like Skittles eat real fruit not this 
691,Bf2pzWcyy5U,over 100 ingredients in here you are led to believe this is 100% chicken I even asked them is your grilled chicken sandwich is that 100% chicken it would be real big trouble but a small amount of research will show you there are actually 46 ingredients in this grilled chicken patty what's in here soybean oil and canola oil modified corn starch processed sugar xantham gum dimethyl polysiloxane which is an ingredient in Silly Putty is in here this is nowhere close to 100% chicken and that's not the end of it 61 ingredients in this bun also containing processed sugars seed oils gums and that's not even including the Chick-fil-A sauce which has a first ingredient of soybean oil I'm all for healthier fast food options by marketing something like this as healthy and having 61 ingredients in this BN and 46 ingredients in this chicken patty That's not healthy that's just us getting played 
692,nyo3x-z0Hfg,there's a lot of food out there that's basically legal drugs in my opinion and manufacturers are smart there's a lot of money behind these businesses craft whatever the parent company of lazes nestle these aggr business multinational corporations are smart they have really smart people working for them who figured out if we make food addictive if we combine these synthetic tastes to make it hit the Bliss point in the human brain and we make it convenient we're good we'll make billions of dollars 
693,S-MdRuRaC4s,this is my morning routine after waking up with the sun I head to the bathroom to take care of business got to love a good poop then I turned the Wi-Fi back on because I had it turned off overnight head into the kitchen drink some reverse osmosis water and a little bit of local gate free honey before heading downstairs for grounding sunlight in the eyes and light movement to start the day this might include some deep squats some bends some squats and some reverse Norm curls after that I get on the balance board activate the Brain before surfing then the surf board gets waxed loaded in the car head to the beach 
694,kY67wF0FXpk,if you have muscle cramps you need to listen to this getting minerals from your food magnesium potassium and calcium is essential for avoiding muscle cramps but a lot of those minerals are not bioavailable in plant Foods they're much more bioavailable in animal Foods if you listen to plant-based Advocates they will tell you that there's just as much zinc in lentils as there is in steak what they're not telling you is the zinc in lentils or beans is not bioavailable meaning when you put that thing into your body and it goes to your stomach you can't get the zinc out of the be or out of the lentils and into your body it just goes right out in your poof the zinc the iron the copper in liver the magnesium in steak or orange juice or milk these are all bioavailable in animal foods and bioavailable in fruits 
695,ycDAdAJW1tA,Dr saladino when you're recommending this diet what risks do you discuss with your patients I don't think there are any risks to eating animal food and you are a psychiatrist am I correct a residency in Psychiatry so what do you know about nutrition what is where did you gain your background in nutrition listen this is I think no you listen to me and answer my question now I'm asking you to tell us where your background emanates from I went to medical school and I studied nutrition in medical school and I stud nutrition indepently one of the C things school that it teaches you how to read articles I'm a doctor medicine needs to think about teaching doctors more nutrition in medical school but it is up to us to educate ourselves just because there's a degree that says a doctor doesn't mean that we have or don't have medical nutritional knowledge the bottom line is you practice Psychiatry am I correct I practice medicine I think you practice Psychiatry is that correct medicine 
696,T8Mlb8UwFSg,here's why you should eat more cheese there are tons of research studies of All Sorts Interventional observational showing associations between increased full fat Dairy consumption like cheese or whole milk and lower rates of cardiovascular disease diabetes obesity Etc we know that cheese milk these dairy products are full of so many nutrients that are essential for optimal human health things like vitamin K2 choline calcium riboflavin these are essential for human thriving energy libido vit it and cheese is freaking delicious raw parmesano regano is one of my favorites eat more cheese you'll thrive

698,5sfYdF5hH4A,the following clip on raw milk was removed from YouTube but it's so important and so helpful that I really want you guys to see this raw milk cafir is an incredibly nutritionally dense whole food that's fantastic for the gut microbiome and it's extremely complex with all this diversity of bacteria there's history with this yes it goes back thousands and thousands of years if you think about it the Messi the Mongolians Europeans everybody around the world sheep horses reindeer camels water buffalo if you could find a mammal you had grass and sunshine you had food today we cohabitated so closely to these animals they're not foreign to us Ram mil cafir was a natural outgrowth of that because if you think about it the container that the person that was milking the cow wasn't clean it had residues from the milk prior week and those were the local cultures within 6 to 10 hours it became a cfir cheers cheers 
699,duSztJPud78,sweet green just announced they are removing oils from their cooking oil and phasing it out from their salad dressings this is amazing guys last year I did a video calling them out sweet green what kind of oil all going to be sunflow oil the chicken is cooked in sunflower oil too we're having sunflower oil and safflower oil as their cooking oils and in tons of their salad dressings and because of that video and because a lot of customers complained they listen I'm so stoked that a huge fast casual salad chain would listen to these criticisms and wake up to the fact that these oils are harmful for humans why do I think oils are harmful for humans the polyunsaturated fats and oils accumulate in cell membranes accumulate in a phospholipid in your mitochondria cardial lipen and break your metabolism that's the high level explanation I believe strongly that these soils ever in the human Diet before 100 years ago first introduced as machine lubricants are one of the single greatest causes if not the single greatest cause of increased obesity diabetes and chronic illness in the US population these oils are horrible for humans and I'm so stoked that sweet greens listen 
700,RZDoHVL5Hqs,your pumpkin spice latte contains 27 ingredients the second ingredient is processed sugar 50 g of processed sugar this single drink contains 390 calories a significant amount of which is processed sugar this also contains kagenin and emulsifier a thickening agent consistently shown in animal studies and human cell culture trials to be inflammatory and irritating for the human gut food grade kagenin is also consistent L found to have significant amounts of nonfood grade degraded kagenin which is a known cancer-causing agent and is clearly damaging for the gut and that's in here this also contains preservatives like sulfur dioxide which can worsen asthma in people who are sensitive this is not a coffee this is ultra processed junk food foods like this are why so many Americans are fat sick and unhealthy and they're hidden from us but if you really want to have a coffee just get a plain coffee guys don't get this 
701,2HHDc8kL6SQ,your vitamin C supplement has a dirty little secret look at this guys vitamin C supplements are ascorbic acid synthetic ascorbic acid is made from GMO corn and the vast majority of GMO corn is sprayed with Roundup glyphosate weed killer when you look at head-to-head studies of naturally occurring vitamin C in something like an orange versus synthetic ascorbic acid it's not surprising that this is beneficial for humans but this doesn't seem to do much of anything in a head-to-head study of cimu Camu berries versus ascorbic acid in Smokers Only naturally occurring vitamin C from cimu cerries lower oxidative stress in observational studies consumption of synthetic vitamin C has also been associated with worsening of metrics of cardiovascular disease so here's the deal this is actually made from GMO corn eat more of this and less of synthetic this if you truly want to be healthy 
702,ZumgNd3i4Z8,these Foods combat hair loss meat eggs liver these foods contain unique nutrients that have been proven repeatedly to slow prevent and in some cases even reverse male and female pattern baldness and other types of hair loss what nutrients am I talking about things like torine carnitine B12 iron zinc and Branch chain amino acids and remember that animal foods like these that's the only place you're going to find valuable nutrients like torine carnitine and vitamin B12 and in terms of iron zinc and brantin amino acids these are by far the most highly bioavailable sources of those so if you or someone you know has any issues with hair loss autoimmune conditions that are causing hair loss you should definitely be including nutrient-rich animal Foods liver eggs meat in your diet in fact I think you should include these Foods all the time because they are a center of a healthy diet for humans and that is how you thrive 
703,Rwkkw_feqvk,this is the best food for sexual health and libido not this this meat like this ribey or ground beef the idea here is that meat and organs animal foods and the unique nutrients they contain these are the most important foods for sexual health for libido for optimal levels of hormones for fertility and for virility for sexual desire you must be getting animal Foods in your diet you must be getting things like vitamin A creatine in carnitine anine torine riboflavin and folate and all of these unique nutrients that occur in animal foods and there are many studies that show that the more saturated fat you get from animals the higher your testosterone whether you are a man or a woman having healthy levels of testosterone is key for sexual health libido sexual desire and sexual performance meat is essential for optimal libido and hormonal health and humans full stop 
704,ZgRoz60ugnc,I'm going to go get a dexa scan after eating an animal- based diet for 5 and 1/2 years okay so visceral fat3 lb it's on the lower end of what I tend to see in dexa scans so what do you think of the bone density clearly above negative 1 so you're in the normal category and then for the C score you're slightly above what's average for someone your age and gender so strong bones dense bones yes says total body fat is 10.5 how many people do you see that have a body fat of 10.5% not many we do scan a lot of bodybuilders pretty close to a show so what is a bodybuilder close to a show what kind of fat do they get range from maybe 8% 7% to 10 or 12 there you go very low visceral fat3 lbs of visceral fat meaning all the fat around my organs very small a lot of people get worried about fruit and honey increasing visceral fat no evidence for that living proof right here bone density normal total body fat 10.5% pretty lean seems to do my body pretty good 
705,6sU8HX0awro,this is my supplement stack I just took a multivitamin creatine collagen and electrolytes and this is what it looks like I can get all of those things in highly bioavailable forms in food check it out I've got Raw Liver that is the best multivitamin on the planet choline carnitine anserine torine vitamin K2 copper biotin riboflavin I've got creatine in grass-fed meat I've got some salt on there that's electrolytes ooh mosquito I've got bioavailable collagen here from bone br I made myself and I've got my electrolytes from fresh coconut water out of Nature's can that I get every morning and every evening getting enough micronutrients getting enough things like this is essential for optimal human health and this is why I'm such a fan of an animal-based diet of organs meat fruit honey and raw dairy because you can get all of these critical nutrients in bioavailable form in food and this is how humans truly thrive 
706,3YbN1-ShEtE,what is beef Tallow this is one of my favorite cooking fats beef Tallow is rendered beef fat so they'll trim fat from a cow either from below the skin above the muscle or around the kidneys you boil it down you render the fat you separate the connective tissue and you end up with liquid gold which is beef Tallow why do I like this it's high in fat soluble nutrients which are valuable for humans that concentrate in the fat of animals bioavailable vitamin E vitamin K2 choline all of these things are in beef fat along with special sat saturated fats that are actually healthy for humans like steer acid an 18 carbon saturated fat that in human trials triggers fat burning and in animal studies leads to leanness of animals I believe there's a good amount of evidence to suggests that eating more beef Tallow is a good way to be less hungry and to lose weight and you'll be healthier because of all the nutrients in here so this is one of my favorite fats eat more beef Tallow this is a health food 
707,7VCxmMFZSGQ,cholesterol I get so many questions about this you guys and whether eating red meat will raise your cholesterol the question you should be asking is are you metabolically healthy and I believe that if you are metabolically healthy you don't care if your cholesterol goes up a little bit if you eat red meat my cholesterol is high I'll be honest with you many doctors would tell me to get on a Statin but I'm not going to do that because I'm metabolically healthy it's easy to test this you can just get a fasting insulin and we know that in humans who are metabolically healthy levels of LDL cholesterol are horribly bad at predicting cardiovascular disease I believe Western medicine is lying to you that you've been misled by fallacies pared by your doctor regarding cholesterol and red meat and saturated fat in fact cholesterol is beneficial in the human body participating in the immune response being associated with healthy levels of hormones and fertility and being associated with significant longevity in old age this is a health food don't fear it when it comes to cholesterol but you must be metabolically healthy and you guys know how to do that if you follow me 
708,_Q6ypwLf2Ok,seed oils are inflammatory when you eat seed oils like this soybean oil large amounts of linolic acid accumulate in all of your cells and tissues including your LDL cholesterol particles linolic acid is an 18 carbon Omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid that is very fragile and prone to oxidation and these seed oils are full of it having lots of this fatty acid in your cells and LDL particles is a very bad idea we see this very clearly in the medic literature which shows that when more seed oils are introduced into the human diet inflammatory markers like oxidized LDL LP ltil a lpa2 and CRP C reactive protein go up these are not good things and they are clearly indications of increased inflammation with seed oils like this anyone who says seed oils aren't inflammatory has never read this research if you want to decrease inflammation and be healthier completely remove seed oils like all of these from your diet 
709,noAACLJ92Ys,this is a river of raw cheese I can just reach my hand in here and grab some of these raw cheese curds this is how cheese gets made these are then pressed in these metal boxes right here and they end up becoming a block of cheese this is a one day old 40 lb block of raw cheese I learned a lot coming to this raw Creamery here in California if you want truly raw cheese you have to call the manufacturer and ask what their vat temperature is a lot of raw cheese is being made are heated higher than you want they may even be pasteurized there's no regulation around the term raw and cheese but at this Dairy which is raw Farm it's really cool they even say on the label heated to 102Â° F so this cheese is truly raw retaining all of the bioactive elements all the peptides all the imunoglobulin all the nutrients it's incredibly nutritious for humans it's incredibly cool to see it getting made 
710,viD8zw1LNUA,would I wear Lululemon shorts not a chance what's in these what are they made of they're made of polyester and that's not something I'm going to put next to my body without wearing some sort of cotton or wool natural fabric underwear to protect me from what's in these shorts in experiments in humans when polyester shorts and underwear are wrapped around the testicles decreased fertility decreased male hormones and decreased sperm production occurs in humans many of the shorts leggings and other clothes at Lululemon and other manufacturers also contain PF phase forever chemicals that can be absorbed through the skin get stuck in the human body that are hard to get rid of associated with hormone disruption cancers potentially damage to liver kidney and thyroid in the human body what's in this is meant to be stained and water resistant that means they have to put chemicals like these forever chemicals in there and I don't want these being absorbed through my junk so if I were going to wear these shorts I would wear cotton or wool ironwear underneath to protect me from them I just prefer to wear cotton shorts instead it's much safer 
711,cfWPcNAVRMI,can you detox from fluoride fluoride is an element found in almost 100% of drinking water in the United States and the world the best way to start detoxing from fluoride is to stop drinking any fluoridated water and stop using any toothpaste that contain fluoride those are the two biggest sources but there's actually really interesting medical evidence that the Tamarind fruit can improve fluoride excretion check out this study of consumption of only 10 G of Tamarind fruit per day for 30 days which significantly increase the excretion of flid in participants fluoride is something that's very controversial it's been used to protect our teeth from Decay but I think the real way to protect your teeth from decays by getting enough fat soluble vitamins from meat and organs I don't think we need fluoride in our water to protect our teeth from cavities and I think that excess fluoride from our water and from toothpaste is causing health issues in humans accumulating our bones damaging our kidneys potentially damaging our pineal glands so getting rid of fluoride in your water fluoride toothpaste and potentially using something like Tamarind fruit to detox fluoride 
712,zu1xaSZFSVA,I had horrible eczema when I was a kid and when I was an adult raw milk protects kids from asthma eczema and allergies I wish that I had access to raw milk when I was a kid it certainly may have helped my Eczema or my asthma things that I suffered with throughout my life raw milk is an incredibly nutrient-rich healing food for humans and it's so cool to see that people are waking up to this and it's becoming more and more available throughout the United States if you have any of these issues or your kids have any of these issues I I think you should consider getting them on more raw milk 
713,kR62XvqfM8A,a lot of you guys asked me how I travel eating animal based like this glass container grilled up some heart I got some burgers that I grilled up it's 80 20. grass fed ground beef and I will I'll put some salt on there I can even put honey on the burgers so it kind of soaks in and I can take it on the plane but you can take this whole thing of meat there's really no limit to how much meat you can take on a plane I haven't I've been having trouble finding liver in Los Angeles I'm traveling to Australia right now but I got some whole package from hard and soil supplements that's got testicle and liver and blood and then our new one is joint repair 
714,lIKzUNc7gAw,to reduce their environmental footprint hopdoddy did something amazing they got rid of plant-based burgers and added more regeneratively raised real beef to the menu yes this is true plant-based meat is a scam in every single way guys it's a scam for your health full of sawdust and Seed oils fillers and garbage things that are damaging your guts it's a scam for the environment it's a scam for environmental Footprints being carbon positive regeneratively raised beef beef that is grass-fed grass-finished rotationally raised that is carbon negative that is much better for ecosystems the soil the grass the health of the animals and the health of you eating it that type of meat is more rich in nutrients props to hopdodi not a sponsored video just wanted to call it out that there are still people in the world who understand what's up and are not misled by the plant-based and understand that regenerative agriculture regeneratively raised beef is probably one of the best things we can possibly do for our environment our planet and our personal health as humans just make sure you get some liver too 
715,E14JfVnhTt8,what's in a McDonald's Big Mac let's find out the bun just bread right nope as the bun contains both canola and soybean oil along with sugar in the bun the meat is actually 100 beef no fillers so that's not bad pickles are just pickles right nope there's 10 ingredients in McDonald's pickles including potassium sorbate polysorbate 80 and aluminum salts none of those are good for humans the lettuce is just lettuce the secret sauce not so secret seed oils canola oil soybean oil propylene glycol high fructose corn syrup and caramel color got another 100 beef patty some more of that seed oil propylene glycol secret sauce and a piece of American cheese which is not actually real cheese full of microplastics so that is what is in your Big Mac at McDonald's is it any wonder that so many Americans are fat sick and unhealthy eat real food guys meat organs fruit honey raw dairy don't eat Ultra processed food like this all kinds of garbage in there is hiding it's 
716,BwxMnUFKqIc,Do you want to build muscle eat meat check this out this is muscle building food not vegetables in terms of bioavailability of actual amino acids and protein there is no comparison with meat red meat especially contains nutrients essential for muscle based performance for Muscle Recovery for muscle building things like creatine amino acids like taurine answering carnitine this is muscle building food it's not kale not vegetables this is how you build mussels this is how you get healthy also Imagine That 
717,LFCTllHo-RM,I believe that every single person has some gift that they can give I feel like we all have this obligation to give that gift in the best way there's this great quote from Steve Prefontaine he said to give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift that's what I want people to understand is that that you have a gift and this sounds cliche but we all have something to give and if you are not your best self in all of these ways and I think that starts with the food the biochemistry the building blocks you put in your body then you are sacrificing the gift and you were doing less than you could for yourself your family for everyone around you 
718,2YwBknT6ub0,this is one of the best foods for human longevity on the planet not this this red meat is a longevity food don't believe me check this out red meat is the best source of multiple nutrients that have clearly been proven to improve human longevity in research trials nutrients like toine creatine carnosine anserine for hydroxyproline and carnitine and none of these nutrients are found in plant Foods so if you want to improve your longevity eat more of this eat more red meat you're welcome 
719,Voacn0f73eM,butter versus ghee what's the difference ghee is clarified butter butter that has been heated and had the milk solids separated some of the milk proteins the lactose the solids and butter are separated and removed and you end up with pure milk fat in ghee I prefer ghee for high heat cooking and if you're lactose intolerant I would go for ghee I think butter and ghee are great for humans they're Health Foods they contain stearic acid and other good fat soluble vitamins like vitamin E and vitamin K2 which I've been shown to improve cardiovascular health so most of the butter here is made from pasteurized milk but if you can find raw butter which is not made from pasteurized that is heated milk and cream this is going to be the best thing to eat I put this on my burgers or lean steaks if I want more fat but raw butter is truly my favorite thing if you can't find raw butter I think ghee is probably the next best thing 
720,CVw0ZGvkPmc,look at this you guys it looks like a piece of coyote poo or something but it's a tamarind it's a fruit that grows in Costa Rica Thailand other places in the world crack the outer shell consumption of Tamarind has actually been shown to increase excretion of fluoride the chemical found in your drinking water in toothpaste all kinds of stuff that accumulates in your bones your kidneys your pineal gland look it even looks more like a poop right now but it tastes pretty good there's like little seeds in here that I'll spit out but I mean I would eat things that look like poo if it helped me get rid of fluoride that I've been accumulating my whole life I don't use toothpaste with fluoride I don't even use toothpaste at all right now I definitely don't drink water with fluoride but if you've been drinking fluoridated water you're using garbage toothpaste your whole life Tamarind it's actually pretty cool 
721,2qNty7ZhbhI,this is why you should be drinking raw milk let's start with the benefits consumption of raw milk in kids who grow up on or off Farms leads to lower rates of asthma eczema and allergies and adulthood raw milk has been associated with beneficial changes in the gut microbiome including increased levels of lactobacillus and raw milk also contains the highest levels of MSM a compound studied and found to improve joint health interestingly in studies looking at raw milk consumption it's been found to be as effective as breastfeeding in reducing respiratory tract infections in kids raw milk also contains multiple factors lactoferrin lysozyme lactoperoxidase immunoglobulins which are protective and prevent the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the raw milk raw milk also contains over 700 species of commensal bacteria in the actual raw milk fluids there are multiple ways to drink raw milk even if you're lactose intolerant you can do kefir which is a fermented raw milk you can do raw cheese or raw butter no matter how you get it getting raw milk raw dairy in your diet is definitely going to improve your health your well 
722,HHZ3CDsvjSg,blue zones don't be fooled by Netflix propaganda there's a recent documentary on Netflix about these five regions of the world where people have exceptional longevity and baked into that narrative is the idea that these regions of the planet all eat plant-based diets which is largely beans whole grains greens nuts and tubers you know in fruits and vegetables as well if you look at these blue zones in four out of the five blue zones Sardinia icaria nikoya and Okinawa significant amounts of meat are eaten this is not even able to be debated and meat forms the center of their culture there are traditional dishes in all of these places that are centered around celebration of meat and organs what about regions of the world like Hong Kong where there is also exceptional longevity and they eat some of the highest amounts of meat in the world there's a huge amount of evidence looking at unique nutrients and meat associated with longevity people in this Region's treasure Community meaning in their lives eat organs and eat meat they do things that they enjoy and they spend time with family that leads to longevity eating a plant-based diet nothing to do with longevity 
723,SH5VtA7DjcI,is this going to raise your cholesterol I get this question all the time guys and this is the wrong question the first question is are you metabolically healthy I'll be honest with you my cholesterol is high I've checked it on my blood work but I am metabolically healthy I know this and so I do not fear red meat and why would I this is one of the most nutrient-rich Foods on the planet this is a health food I believe that the whole narrative around cholesterol LDL and red meat and saturated fat is wrong that essentially you've been lied to by your doctor there are all of these medical ideas that are fallacies parented in medical schools enforced by pharmaceutical companies this is a health food you do not need to fear saturated fat from red meat if you are metabolically healthy how do you get metabolically healthy eliminate seed oils eliminate processed sugars get rid of the garbage eat meat and organs eat Health Food true health food and don't worry about your cholesterol that's different than what western medicine will tell you but this will help you thrive for real 
724,IMETkCp7zgQ,collagen is valuable for hair skin nails ligaments Muscle Recovery what's the best way to get it my favorite way to get it is to make my own bone broth you can get something like this like a hydrolyzed beef gelatin powder but I want to make my own bone broth because I know what's in it and I always feel like it's probably a little more bioavailable when it's fresh so how do I make my own bone broth so I'm going to get bones I start I like knuckle bones because I've got a lot of collagen in them or oxtail collagenous Cuts I put them in the instant pot with reverse osmosis water and I use a stew feature and maybe pressure cooks for an hour and then that is the end product once you make bone broth like that you get collagenous goodness full of all sorts of nutrients that you can only find in animal foods like four hydroxyproline which has been associated with improved skin texture and tone on the face but getting enough collagen is essential and it reminds us of all of these unique nutrients only found in animal Foods 
725,K8L5TUY49ug,meat substitutes why do they make him look like me so are you looking like chicken well that's looking like a burger there's a clear answer here and I don't think that vegans see the irony in this and this is said with all the empathy and love and compassion for vegans in the world you're clearly craving meat in your mind and we know this there are studies where we put EEG leads on people's heads we may have talked about the study in the past and you can show people who are vegetarian or vegan pictures of meat and you can show omnivore pictures of meat in the conscious brain vegans and vegetarians have an aversive response to meat omnivores have a positive response but in the unconscious brain both the vegans the vegetarians and the omnivores have a positive response to the meat that's why it's shaped like meat because even though you have decided that you don't want to eat meat your brain and your body still knows that meat is foundational for human history life Vitality it's a part of our Evolution that is inescapable it probably made us human 
726,814Nby7BbAY,this is why I'm drinking pet food Sprouts in Texas this is not pet food this is raw kefir this is fermented raw milk made at Raw Farm in California I've been to this farm and seen how this is made but here's the catch direct sales of raw milk of raw dairy are illegal in 37 States like Texas this to me is a travesty when we know that raw dairy products improve eczema allergies and Asthma something that kills 13 kids a day but consumers can't directly buy raw dairy in the majority of the states in the United States when things like cigarettes processed food seed oils french fries garbage Foods they're legal but raw food isn't so sometimes you got to drink pet food I'm gonna do it [Music] tastes great to me 
727,Gun2sXSDU-s,these Foods combat joint pain and can reverse joint damage this is a cow's scapula and it contains highin cartilage full spectrum cartilage I'm talking cartilage 1 through 5 9 10 11 glucosamine and kroen scapular cartilage is going to be much more valuable for repairing damaged joints than ho and hide cartilage which is the lowest quality cartilage and what is usually found in collagen supplements you've also got some bone marrow here which is going to have growth factors peptides and stem cells tracheal cartilage has been studied widely by John Pruden found to modulate the immune system positively and benefit you in wound healing I always try and get these things fresh or make a bone broth out of these things but I know many of you may not be able to get one of these one of these so I'm super excited about our new supplement at harden soil which we specifically formulated with these hardto find sources of bone repairing nutrients scapular cartilage bone marrow and tracheal cartilage and it's called Joint repair check it out at hard and.co if you can't get this stuff fresh 
728,dpLy_wTEKMM,look at this guys this is Criminal the marketing just the the amount of deception the duplicity eat meaty there's something meaty about this there's no meat in here there's no chicken in here it's made for mushroom root well I mean I don't care if it's mushroom or peas it's not the same as chicken or beef and it's crazy that manufacturers can write these things on here I don't think anybody's being fooled but look I love you vegans I love you vegetarians that's the first step to being carnivore and animal-based trust me but if you're craving chicken I or you're craving steak there's probably a reason for it stop eating mushroom mycelium and just eat some meat 
729,ow_OT_G0g-8,there's anecdotes of zookeepers not feeding Lions organs and the Lions become lethargic and they don't even want to mate because zookeepers are just feeding them muscle meat they're not feeding them organs and they realize like hey wait the species appropriate diet for a lion is they're gonna get a kill and eat the whole animal they're gonna eat the organs lo and behold you feed the lion the bones marrow the cartilage liver heart kidney whatever they're going to eat from the animal they're super healthy again there probably is a species-appropriate diet for humans and that's what's interesting to me but just giving people a framework to think like this is what makes the most sense evolutionarily anthropologically or you can arrive at that the kind of like reverse engineering looking at the nutrients that humans need to thrive and thinking about how you get there so there's two ways to arrive and for me that that arrives at like the exact same point which is this animal-based diet meat organs fruit honey raw dairy give or take 
730,StoXHI5tOLc,this is kale think about this guys this is a leaf of a plant the plant clearly doesn't want you to eat this this is for the plant to gather sunlight in the leaves to do photosynthesis to make carbohydrates that a plant uses for its own energy they don't want you to eat this there are tons of Defense chemicals in here including isothiocyanates which inhibit the absorption of iodine in your body not everyone has tons of problems with vegetables but I've seen people in chronic health issues that were not getting better improve so often when they get vegetables like kale out of their diets look if you're doing great if you're thriving maybe eat some kale if you want from time to time but I think most of you are going to do way better have less gas less bloating less GI issues less joint pain and feel much better overall without this in your diet without vegetables in your diet and more of this and this which is liver in your diet more of these less of this 
731,6XFbjCrqLs4,I know you love Nutella but this is a Nutella takedown the second ingredient in Nutella is vegetable oil is seed oil the second ingredient so you're combining seed oils with a nut which is a seed which is going to have lectins digestive enzyme Inhibitors Fates oxalates listen I ate Nutella when I was a kid too chocolate butter spread amazing not good for you clearly not good for you at all just get rid of the Nutella in fact get rid of like all of the peanut butters and nut Butters and just use regular butter just use cow butter how about that and if you want something sweet just get honey or maple syrup 
732,p9kIeazi1q8,before 1990 McDonald's french fries were cooked in beef fat beef Tallow since then they're cooked in seed oils corn canola soybean and partially hydrogenated soybean oil which is a trans fat but because people like the taste of beef fat now McDonald's uses natural beef flavor in their french fries what's in natural beef flavor wheat and Milk ingredients so these fries are not gluten free those wheat ingredients are potentially going to damage your gut and irritate your gut further beyond the seed oils that are in here and all of this because people like the taste of beef fat which is incredibly nutritious at Baseline but McDonald's wants to cook in seed oils which are very likely harmful for you in so many different ways it's crazy to think about all the nasty ingredients in McDonald's french fries they would be so much better if they just went back to cooking them in beef tallow 
733,Tb5e0WreIi4,oysters what do I think well they're pretty nutrient Rich they've got essential fatty acids they got zinc they got iodine in them I'd say they're a good fruit for humans the only thing to be careful of is a lot of oysters will accumulate heavy metals because they're on the bottom of the ocean so I wouldn't eat them to excess I don't put a lot of seafood in my diet but I do eat it from time to time so cheers to that raw Easter Down the Hatch pretty good oh 
734,lyrE7-61PHA,ice cream is a health food it's so good but this is not just any ice cream this is animal-based ice cream that I made myself how do you make animal-based ice cream you start with raw cream you add organic fruit this is dragon fruit flavor this is mango flavored you add a little bit of sea salt I have raw egg yolks in there I have glyphosate free honey and I've got some hard and soil supplements so I've got beef organs and colostrum in both of these animal-based ice creams in a blender then you put it in the freezer for a few hours and boom voila you get Anil based ice cream this is a health food especially when it's made this way raw egg yolks contain choline vitamin K2 biotin riboflavin folate so many incredible nutrients for your brain and for your body sixty percent of the immunologically Active Components in Dairy are found in the milk fat that's concentrating the cream do not eat regular ice cream but you don't have to give up one of the most enjoyable foods for humans in your life you can make animal-based ice cream do not fear truly raw anal-based ice cream like this you're welcome 
735,XXngFqZi0Og,green smoothie versus animal-based smoothie I used to love these when I was a vegan they both have nutrients but the nutrients in here not super bioavailable because they're from plant foods like kale and spinach and the problem with the green smoothie is that when you're trying to get your nutrients you're also getting a ton of anti-nutrients things like oxalates with kidney stones phytic acid with vines minerals isothiocyanates which is bad for your thyroid this really doesn't add up when you think about it but animal-based smoothie tons of nutrients because there are organs in here we got some beef organs to get heart liver kidneys feeding pancreas in there with some raw kefir vitamin A choline and Serene taurine CoQ10 riboflavin folate and they're all bioavailable I'm so much more a fan of an anime smoothie than a plant-based green smoothie now 
736,9LLnNbuifkw,grocery stores are really interesting to me we are Hunters as humans and in 2023 this is where we hunt but we've forgotten how to hunt we come to the grocery store we don't even know what to buy anymore and we're so confused is this healthy is that healthy what about this additive it's hard to read the labels so many of the foods that we are selecting that we are hunting and gathering in grocery stores are full of garbage ingredients they're full of artificial flavors artificial sweeteners they're full of thickeners they're full of pesticides they're full of things like appeal coatings on vegetables that make them probably not healthy for humans at all and it's crazy to me that we don't really have a sense an intuition of what's healthy for humans we've been told so many things but if you just remember where you've come from and what humans have always sought it's clear we're seeking meat organs with the meat and we're seeking sweet things that are in season that's how you remember how to hunt in a place like this 
737,-tnWOdPGuUA,eggs are the best shampoo you guys might think I'm crazy but check this out eggs contain many nutrients in the white and the yolk that are proven in research studies to penetrate the scalp and nourish the hair follicle things like zinc taurine carnitine vitamin B12 Branch chain amino acids are found in egg yolks and whites they all benefit your hair follicles when you rub them into your scalp like this and you know what's awesome about egg yolks they don't have any of the other ingredients found in traditional shampoos things like perfumes and fragrances which can be phalanes endocrine disruptures things like pfas per fluoro alkyl compounds things like other xenoestrogens other hormonal disrupting compounds that can also penetrate your scalp and get into your body listen mainstream shampoo is  but how cool is it that you can use something as natural as an egg to wash your hair nourish the follicles support hair growth and hair maintenance try it out 
738,yH0YNS-9HOk,regular Gatorade Nature's Gatorade watermelon juice got orange juice got pineapple juice you got coconut water these fruit juices are amazing sources of electrolytes of minerals and they contain so many compounds bound to be beneficial in humans do not fear fruit juice watermelon juice we know improves nitric oxide in the body involved in blood vessel dilitation that's probably an amazing natural Viagra orange juice contains hesperidin and orangin the benefits of orange juice are hard to overstate improving endothelial function improving all sorts of indices of immunologic function in humans lowering the potential of LDL to get oxidized decreasing cardiovascular risk pineapple juice contains bromelain a compound that protects the gut from organisms like vibrio cholera and E coli and has also been studied and found to lower blood pressure and have other cardiovascular benefits coconut water it's got potassium it's got magnesium and all kinds of good electrolytes in there to help quench your thirst when you go to the gym when you're working out why would you use this when you could use some of these 
739,IDFYVIRKLa8,are these healthy foods worsening your joint pain all of these foods contain compounds that are clearly linked to worsening of arthritis joint pain and damage to your joints if you can't do movements like a deep squat your joints probably aren't as healthy as they should be spinach and almond butter contain oxalates those oxalates can also deposit in your soft tissues and in your joints causing pain and arthritis oats contain all sorts of problematic compounds for humans and oats contain phytic acid a large molecule that keates minerals like magnesium zinc and iron all of which are critical for proper and healthy joints the real bad guy are seed oils the breakdown products of seed oils connected with linolic acid are clearly linked to inflammatory arthropathies like rheumatoid arthritis and if you're eating any of these Foods you probably want to ruin them from your diet 
740,0Kmt0TtD5II,I can't even I'm like almost speechless of this one you got a vegan buttery spread it's a butter alternative wait what is actually better than butter butter is freaking delicious full of good fatty acids for humans like steric acid a longchain saturated fatty acid that we know is essential for Optimal Health encourages mitochondrial Health probably helps with weight loss and satiety but no let's eat a vegan buttery spread with seed oils sunflower and canola oil as the main ingredients and FAA protein in your buttery spread come on guys vegan buttery spread isn't good for humans at all but I think that vegans probably miss the butter and they want the nutrition from there so they'll try and eat this but I'm hoping this video will inspire some of them to just eat some real butter 
741,7xPIfrTW2HM,I've had Crohn's for 20 years or so last year just was down like 50 pounds like from what I'm at now I was on a liquid diet for three months based on like the doctor of the word and that's filled with like all these oh my God so many garbage things I don't think I realized like how crazy it's bad but I got to the point where my large colon was so diseased and stuff it's where they actually had to do an ileostomy so I had an ileostomy wow in August yeah and then went on the diet ate meat and fruit and they were able to do a reversal oh my God that's so amazing that's so cool they didn't even know that was like a freaking option doctors never talk they never tell you 
742,a8-hxdyDaaI,I get questions sometimes what do I eat I'm a huge fan of an animal-based diet and this means based on animal Foods so what do I have for lunch today I got meat grass-fed beef burgers raw cheese fruit cherries bananas and I got some hard and soil supplements for the organs but that's what I eat I avoid things like grains I avoid oatmeal I avoid seed oils and I focus on animal foods and fruit and honey and that works really well for me and so many people that's an animal-based diet that's what you eat 
743,yv-lJ1Xw8z8,so when I'm at farmers markets I'll often look for honey and you can ask the people at the farmers market and what I do is I'll ask what's used on the farm are there any pesticides used on the farm how big is the farm and so this is from a permaculture Farm there's no pesticides used so you know it's going to be a a glyphosate free honey this is important when you're sourcing honey to know where it comes from and how big the farm is a small farm or there's glyphosate use within six kilometers then there could be glyphosate in the honey it's not the end of the world but I'd rather have like say free honey than have the size of my honey the bees are going to concentrate the pesticides so an organic honey or a honey from a farm that you know is really cool and every honey is going to taste different this honey I've had before and it's been darker right now it's a little bit lighter in color because different flowers are in bloom but honey is like wine it's it has tewar it has a flavor based on where it's sourced and that's pretty cool so honey it's a huge part of my diet and it's awesome to come to farmers markets where I can actually talk to the farmer and now how good the quality the honey is 
744,Glw10Zpfcdw,bang energy here's what I think let's look at the nutrition label so it says there's zero calories but the way they get zero calories is by adding sucralose we know that sucralose and Splenda is a problem because it disrupts the gut Flora by interrupting the way they communicate and when you drink something with sucralose along with any carbohydrate containing foods there's good evidence in humans that is going to cause increased insulin and increase glucose leading to pre-diabetic type physiology no bueno bang also wants you to think it's beneficial because it has nutrients like vitamin B6 or niacin or vitamin B12 guess what you can get all of those things in much more highly bioavailable forms along with tons of other good nutrients in something like a steak this is the real bang energy this is just pretending 
745,_TO-GoZo8Lw,many imported olive oils are fake meaning they're cut with vegetable oils seed oils like corn canola soybean sunflower which is obviously inferior quality to a pressed olive oil and even California olive oils have been shown to be often rancid oxidized and essentially spoiled the UC Davis Center on olive oil has actually looked at this and has found that the vast majority of imported olive oils and olive oils produced in California are not that healthy so if you can find a really good olive oil that you trust that you know is not cut with seed oils then it is certainly better than seed oils I still prefer animal fats like Tallow butter or ghee but if you want to put a good olive oil on your salad I don't know why you eat a salad make sure you look for something that is organic that is cold pressed that is recently harvested you want to be able to see the harvest date on the label and you want to make sure it's in a dark glass bottle 
746,BCugCamImrY,37 states have banned one of the most healing foods for your children raw milk raw dairy this is one of the saddest realities that I've come across in my research and my learning and I've met hundreds of parents and hundreds of kids from those parents who have benefited from including raw dairy and getting rid of pasteurized dead Dairy and milk in their lives I've heard of improvements in all sorts of things from gut discomfort diarrhea constipation bloating inflammatory bowel diseases skin conditions like eczema sleep issues in all of these cases I've heard of parents having incredible stories of success with their children and children leading lives with significantly improved quality from including a food that is not able to be obtained that is illegal in 37 States in their diets I so hope that this changes in the future and I'm calling on those 37 states to wake up and to allow you to be able to get raw milk and raw dairy because this food is healing for humans and it absolutely will improve so many kids who continue to suffer today 
747,J-sI8V4Q4No,one of the most fun things that I do now with my content is this I call it like Health journalism and I put on the mic and my buddy's kind of filming me surreptitiously like he's being kind of subtle in the background and we walk into restaurants and I go well I have a food allergy can you tell me what your food is cooked in and it's interesting understanding what's happening there and most restaurants are cooking in seed oils they're using corn or Canola or soybean or safflower and most of them are doing it thinking that they're doing it correctly I mean Chick-fil-A uses peanut and on their website they say peanut oil is healthy for humans it's heart healthy again it goes back to this thing that we talked about earlier it may lower LDL but then it raises the oxidized form like the broken down sort of oxidized really atherosclerotic form of LDL but most of these businesses don't understand and the consumer demand has been polyunsaturated oils because that's what we've been told is healthy for the last really last 50 to 70 years but especially in the last 30 years

758,1wVbmZLb2pY,sometimes when I show orange juice people get all worried about the sugar and they say it's just it's just sugar water and if you look at the medical literature there's so much showing that orange juice is beneficial for humans especially fresh squeezed orange juice like this there's studies in diabetics showing that orange juice lower triglycerides and improves insulin sensitivity there's studies with white blood cells and humans showing that chronic consumption of orange juice improves inflammatory markers in those white blood cells the inside of your blood vessels is lined with endothelium there's studies that orange juice improves in the endothelial function the inside of your blood vessels so this is not something to be feared this is like a treasure orange juice is this is just amazing stuff cheers 
759,9UijaqNt8rg,I want to tell you guys about my nighttime routine it's almost sunset in Costa Rica because I'm near the equator it's like the same amount of daylight and night year round so I know that the sun is going to come up early tomorrow and I want to get to Surf early so I go to sleep early You're gonna laugh at this but I usually go to sleep around 8 or 8 30 and I stop looking at my phone a few hours before I go to sleep I want to stop eating a few hours before I go to sleep but I don't do intermittent fasting anymore I avoid blue light at night so all the lights in my house after dark are candles or red lights and I try to not do super stimulating things like watching TV which I don't do in general and the night before I go to sleep before I go to sleep immediately I'll take 20 minutes maybe 15 or 20 minutes put my feet up on the wall that helps me kind of chill out and I'll listen to an audiobook and I've got a grounding mat on my bed so all that stuff is going to happen soon after I watch the sunset 
760,UJlvVfHRCFU,I actually don't have a major problem with you eating vegetables if you have nagging pain in your joints or your muscles sleep issues insomnia mood issues skin issues autoimmune conditions low libido I have seen a lot of people benefit from removing vegetables the leaves stems roots and seeds of plants from their diets no one debates that vegetables contain defense chemicals but these defense chemicals don't seem to be problematic for everyone if you are thriving if you don't have any of the conditions I mentioned then eat some vegetables if you would like if they make you happy if you enjoy The Taste the texture or the flavor cook the crap out of them but remember and be honest with yourself that if you have underlying issues I've seen a lot of people get better when they remove vegetables from their diet and decrease their intake of the plant defense chemicals that come with these so if you're thriving eat your vegetables enjoy your life but if you're not and you go to your doctor with these issues almost no doctor will suggest that these plant defense chemical containing vegetables could be at the root of your problem

762,Pm-TuyXPofo,here's why you should eat more fermented foods look I'm a fan of these you've got pickles in here you've got sauerkraut down here with just cabbage water and salt in there you've got kefir here these are all fermented foods we know that fermented foods raise the diversity of your gut Flora we call this Alpha diversity in studies fermented foods raise the alpha diversity and that's usually going to be beneficial for your gut fiber doesn't raise the alpha diversity fermented foods raise the alpha diversity sauerkraut when you ferment the Cabbage it gets rid of most of the anti-nutrients pickles especially when they're fermented properly pickles are great kefir very beneficial for your gut all of these will increase the alpha diversity but getting more fermented foods really a good thing for most humans especially if you have gut issues

764,79p7ZHHiFwo,meat and fruit as the primary Foods in a diet is this [Â __Â ] I don't think so bro I love this this is an animal-based diet you've got the most nutrient Retreats on the planet meat and organs these are the foods our ancestors always saw preferentially we've got raw dairy like cheese or milk shown to benefit kids for allergy eczema and Asthma the least toxic plant Foods fruit it's colorful it's sweet yes avocados a fruit you've got collagen and bone broth these are the foods that I truly believe help humans Thrive I've actually been eating mean fruit as my primary foods for the last three years because it made sense to me that those are the foods I would seek out it seemed like common sense then when my two-year-old ran into some chronic illness I used that and it totally solved it he's thriving now my mom is approaching 70 eating the same two primary foods and thriving so it works for us and I've seen it work for tens of thousands of people meat is a health food meat is a food for longevity fruit and honey are probably the best sources people use for carbohydrates nutrients from organs are difficult to find other places this is truly a diet that helps humans Thrive so Cheers Cheers brother 
765,Fk1Seipqc3I,so I'm in the mall and I'm walking by the Oakley store and looking at all the sunglasses in there and I'm thinking are we sure we want to be wearing sunglasses during the day don't we want the sunlight in our eyes to entrain our circadian rhythms the first thing I do when I get up in the morning is put my bare feet on the ground and look to the bright Sky not directly at the Sun but I look too bright Sky to set my circadian rhythm for the day that's a huge thing for our circadian clocks our daily Fox with all of our hormones I think a lot of people out there maybe you are gonna put sunglasses on first thing in the morning and never get good bright sunlight in their eyes some of the day you want to be outside without sunglasses the sun is not bad for your eyes the sun is necessary to go into your eyes to touch the photoreceptors at the back of your eyes to entrain your circadian rhythm know that some sunlight in your eyes especially in the morning and in the evening when the Sun is setting it's going to be very beneficial don't just wear them all day 
766,GWheYMsm8QY,I'm a type 1 diabetic I'm diagnosed like six years ago okay I've been on it for six months so it's full of grace and my A1C went from a 7.1 to a five nine that's amazing my doctor said he's never had a patient his entire career Put on numbers like this really and yeah he's like whatever you're doing keep it up man I I told him about you I'm like dude this guy's changed my life I was having sleeping issues eye twitch and all gone it's crazy how many carbohydrates are you eating because it's a type 1 diabetic you probably want to keep that a little lower I mean obviously I'm taking insulin I eat like spoonfuls of honey and you're still principles of honey and your A1C went down yeah that's amazing 
767,GMGJJjf3wjk,is the infant formula that we're giving kids the reason that they're becoming obese and pre-diabetic in childhood it possibly could be look at this guys the number one selling brand of infant formula in the United States is full of seed oils sunflower oil and soybean oil and the fourth ingredient is pure sugar what are we doing to our children filling their cell membranes filling their mitochondria with seed oils our bodies can't get rid of these easily this could definitely set these kids up for obesity for becoming fat as kids for developing early autoimmune illness for developing chronic disease becoming pre-diabetic kids how many kids today are getting put on medications for diabetes and obesity that could easily be avoided by not giving them formulas full of garbage ingredients and Seed oils when they're infants this has to change about our society our children are suffering they're becoming ill like never before and I think it could be in part related to the foods we're giving them as soon as they're born 
768,QwZ_I35iSpw,this food is illegal in the United States in the majority of the U.S raw milk and raw dairy cannot be sold to consumers in grocery stores this is an incredibly healing food and so much scientific literature supports its ability to improve asthma eczema allergies gut flora and yet this is illegal when cigarettes alcohol marijuana processed foods full of seed oils and processed sugars clearly things that are harmful for humans these are all legal you can buy them in every state in every grocery store but you can't get one of the most Healing Foods on the planet for humans raw milk this is insane guys this is ludicrous and this is something that I want to help bring awareness to and be a part of changing so that you can have access to Healing Foods like this 
769,DLkK4r37qLU,phthalates are making your penis small yes water failing so phthalates are these synthetic compounds found in fragrances when I get an Uber and there's a black ice I can't wait you and I could talk for hours go on there's a black ice tree in the on the rearview mirror and you're smelling it right and you're thinking oh this is gross I roll down the window and you get out of the Uber and you still smell like black ice right those are phthalates they're sticky they carry fragrance every time you walk into a room and you see those Glade plugins in the corner it's putting phthalates into the air so these these compounds they're in perfumes not all perfumes but some of them are worse than others they're in lotions but these are clearly endocrine disruptor this word xenoestrogen is the fancy word for endocrine disruptors they mimic estrogen in both men and women and then they accumulate in women's body the pathways probably that women are exposed to these and if they're carrying a male fetus then it affects the male during gestation and it leads to shrinking of the distance between the butthole and the end of the testicles which is the anal genital distance which is an indication of feminization of males and then shrinking of the penises 
770,936mFN4jAyM,some quote healthy sunscreens contain seed oils yep so just like you don't want to eat a seed oil you don't want to put a seed oil on your skin like sunflower seed oil like sunflower I've seen that a ton of products one of the things I worry about most with linoleic acid and Seed oils is it accumulating in the skin and don't put seed oils on your skin and realize that if you're eating seed oils your skin is more susceptible to aging so that's what I really want women to know we need sun on our face on our eyes and our skin all these things and I don't want women to fear that and I think the way to make your skin resilient and healthy for as long as possible is to eat a very low linoleic acid diet because you think it's in every summer when you bought 
771,EBo0DtNH9oQ,backwards walking is hold on a second look backward walking is like Nature's knee exercise you're in a position to get stronger and hand circulation you can help people who can't even walk anymore by walking backward in the water actually and then for elite athletes you can add resistance to this so it's pretty freaking cool what Mother Nature did that by walking backward we can reverse out problems that's amazing but I gotta tell you the shorts those are bro what are you talking about polyester shorts you know this they're full of all sorts of endocrine disrupting chemicals like pfas para floral alkyl compounds and I'll get into your balls or get into your other good stuff so I want that backwards walking I love it not Gotta Lose the shorts bro all right deal to meet you man

783,2E5Tp_TzyTU,look at this guys I found an animal-based restaurant in Austin they're gonna let me in here come on let's check it out what's up look at this they're cooking chicken on the grill with pure butter on the chicken there's no seed oils on that Grill this place uses no seed oil check it out come on it's all just like fresh organic ingredients they got a bunch of sauces here they do like Greek and Mexican they have a wagyu Burger they have raw milk they make smoothies and the cool thing none of this has seed oils the owner told me that they get emails from people all the time and they get people coming and telling them that they're leaving other places like Chipotle or whatever the cooking seed oils and coming here I love that the change is happening they use no seed oils in the fryers this place is pretty cool guys they have 10 locations in Austin which is amazing to see it expanding but I'm stoked that animal-based restaurants are taking over 
784,aR_UbFkzdXg,I'm here at a four trillion dollar business that's the Health Care system in our country hospitals but what if I told you that this four trillion dollar business doesn't actually get you well doesn't actually do what it's advertising that it's supposed to do the Health Care system in this country isn't designed to get you well it isn't designed to figure out what's causing your illness I know this I'm a doctor I'm a part of this system or at least I was a healthcare system is designed to keep you coming back for pills for treatments that's how profits are maximized but what really gets me a little sick inside and why I do the work I do is because I know that diet and lifestyle are way more powerful than what happens at this business and they're free so if you're sick with anything thyroid disease aches and pains obesity diabetes whatever rheumatoid arthritis interventions like diet and lifestyle should always be your first course of action before you become a lifetime customer at this place that's what I'm trying to change 
785,EWRL1s1dsZ8,red Gatorade no that's watermelon juice that's what I use when I'm skating not at the skate ramp getting a workout outside in nature in the jungle and there's no yellow five red 40 or another  in here just electrolytes potassium magnesium carbohydrates definitely sugars in here I don't worry about that at all for one I'm exercising number two we know that's sugar even if it's fruit sugar and watermelon doesn't cause insulin resistance so what it does do is help me recover from skating which is hard and it improves my muscle glycogen and improves my hormones as I'm doing this plenty of studies that show but athletes who use carbohydrates into your workout or after workout have better Muscle Recovery and better levels of hormones like testosterone so I don't fear watermelon juice at all and you know that it's like 100 times better than red Gatorade I made that myself 
786,QjhqDboV2W8,whenever I talk about fruit you guys always ask me if I worry about blood sugar spikes I don't for a variety of reasons I think that uh blood sugar spikes don't cause pathology for humans sometimes they're a symptom of a problem but I don't believe that eating fruit causes diabetes in anyone if you have diabetes eating fruit may cause your blood sugar to spike more than it would mine as I'm metabolically healthy but that's just a symptom of the fact that your metabolic Machinery is broken so I don't feel sugar that occurs in Fruit I think it's healthy for humans and the insulin Spike that comes with it is healthy helps you conserve electrolytes which are a clear problem on ketogenic low carb diets if you look at somebody on a low carb diet they have massive electrolyte problems because they're not getting any insulin spikes so insulin spikes are healthy for humans so don't fear fruit and these are some of my favorites 
787,cz9kTbr51Bs,come on I want to show you guys what I got I'm at the grass-fed butcher in Costa Rica part the taurine another heart testicles because they're easy to get in Costa Rica they got a bunch of skirt steak that's one of my favorite cuts and I just put it on the grill for a moment and sear it and then I eat it mostly raw mostly pretty stoked but they have now they have raw butter they have raw cheese and they have raw milk here which is amazing make milk raw again I'm so stoked to see more raw milk around and know that I can get raw milk and raw dairy at the butcher by my house in Costa Rica

794,uC8SZ4GLDno,why don't we understand that food is signal and that food is information going into our bodies food is a program that we are loading into the computer of our bodies every day and that's coming in from molecules and the environment right it could be sun it could be cold but the biggest down low the biggest amount of information coming to us is food and I would argue it is the biggest lever for health and disease 
795,YswrOr0A4gQ,this is raw milk Heaven look at this guys I am in the walk-in freezer at Raw Farm in their Creamery and I am surrounded by hundreds of gallons of raw milk hundreds of gallons of raw kefir they got raw cream over here some of the most delicious stuff on the planet full of so many good nutrients for humans which are concentrated in that butter fat in those butter packed Lobby walls man this is just like I've gone to sleep and woken up in heaven If Heaven is like this I want to go to heaven I'm going to be good because I want to go to Milk Heaven you guys this is amazing I hope Heaven is just like this unlimited raw dairy behind you yeah
