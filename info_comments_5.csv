I’m trying to incorporate more balanced meals into my diet and when I saw spinach in oatmeal, I had to at least give it a try. I’ve never had oyster sauce before and sesame oil is something that I like depending on what I eat it with. I made my own chili oil at home because it’s not available where I live, which probably affected the taste. I was very skeptical, staring at the plate for a good few minutes before I finally decided to try it, and here are my personal thoughts. The taste is great, it’s well balanced and it doesn’t feel like it would be heavy on the stomach. For me, because I’m so used to sweet oats as a part of my childhood when my great grandma and grandma would make it for me, I think it might be a texture thing on my part. If I replaced the oats with something like rice or brown rice, maybe even quinoa, I think I would’ve liked it more.

Though it's not completely necessary given the cleaning process between flights, it's recommended that those with severe allergies wipe down their tray table and seat before use since severe reactions are more likely due to contaminated surfaces.

As I mentioned, the recovery process was really difficult and it took me many years to come to terms with it. \n\n2. Since my case was more complex, I never knew how to explain everything in a concise manner.  There’s a lot that I left out, but I think that this video did an okay job at summarizing the main points!  \n\n3. I didn’t want people to make assumptions about my health and relationship with food now.  I am fully recovered from my ED and have been for over 10 years!

I've helped in that time period over a dozen individuals through life problems where they needed someone anyone to actually listen.\nSomeone to give feed back.  Someone to shutup and vent too.

I had a full blown binge eating disorder, and it was really bad. To be honest, food is a double edged sword. It can be so beautiful and can power a person to do incredible things. It can also kill and destroy a person. With its powerful fear/addictiveness. But it is vital for our existence, and for all the wonderful things that we do in life.

The OCD made it so anything which touched the counter was bad in my mind and I began to obsessively clean. This didn't help my ED because I wouldn't eat at all due to fear of preparing food on the counter no matter how many years passed. I also remember days being checked out of school because of lack of energy, and I also remember two occassions becoming sick at school and sobbing in the bathroom waiting for my mom to come pick me up. As for how I'm doing nowaday, my partner and I have been moved away for 2 years now and she is really good about my anxiety around the kitchen and has been assisting me in slowly having a healthier relationship with food. She has actually made me the meal you showed off in this video before!! I'm slowly getting better with my emetophobia too, but somehow the counter issue/my mom's house is still difficult for me due to the OCD and not even the emetophobia anymore, and I have to clean my possessions and take showers after visiting. But at least my health, both physical and mental, have improved. The OCD isn't nearly as bad as the risk the other two issues I grew up with had posed on my life.

However, the body also converts arachidonic acid into molecules that calm inflammation and fight blood clots.  What’s even MORE important to note is that the body converts very little linolenic acid into arachidonic acid, even when linolenic acid (found in omega-6 fats) is abundant in the diet and that eating more omega-6 fats didn’t increase inflammation (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21663641/).  In fact, eating more omega-6 fats have been shown to either reduce markers of inflammation or have no effect on markers.  Many studies and meta-analyses also show decreased rates of heart disease as omega-6 consumption increased, reduced risk of heart attacks and coronary events when replacing saturated fat with omega-6 fats, and reduced heart disease rates when replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats (including omega-6 and omega-3 fats).', 'As a professional chef that has worked in top restaurants and the best culinary school in the world, Do Not eat canola, corn or soybean oil.

Nowadays people are quick to defend MSG and blame racist scientists, which they 100% have the right to. But- MGS is not a ""naturally occuring sodium"". It is a MANUFACTURED/NON-NATURALLY OCCURING form of glutamic acid called D-glutamic acid different from the naturally occuring L-glutamic acid that is found in almost every living thing including us humans, and of course the famous tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu, etc. After all, MSG was originally derived from kombu/seaweed that underwent many different manufacturing steps and chemical reactions before turning into what we know as MSG. Glutamic acids are absolutely essential for functioning, and the L-glutamic acid is bound to proteins and is absorbed slowly when we consume tomatoes and meats and mushrooms. D-glutamic acid is very similar but is free/unbound, so when we eat foods with MSG its absorbed very quickly and glutamate levels shoot up so yes, people can absolutely be sensitive to high levels of glutamates and have symptoms. Like sugar and salt, a moderate amount is just fine (and found ""naturally"" in foods as well), but too much can cause mild toxicity effects in some people - kinda like a ""sugar high"" or a ""dehydration/salt headache"". MSG also just has a lot of sodium in general which we all know can cause headaches, high BP, etc. (Obviously there are scientific nuances to the MSG debate that I didn\'t explain in length, so no need to go full keyboard warrior on me, I am aware :)\n\nTLDR: MSG is a food seasoning that is NOT naturally occuring, what IS natural and everywhere are glutamic acids.

Getting in more fiber and nutrients\n2. Not avoiding carbs\n3. Remembering to include protein with meals\n\nIn this specific example, I’m using broccoli, zucchini, and bell peppers as my veggies, chicken for my protein, and potatoes as my starch/grain. 🤗\n\nHighly recommend trying this out if you’re not a huge fan of calorie counting or food logging!']",11

127,yQUl6vfYbrI,"['First of all, I just want to clarify that pasteurized eggs (such as the ones used in this video as specified in this video) are SAFE TO EAT and do not give you salmonella.  You do increase your risk of salmonella if you’re in the US and eat unpasteurized raw eggs. \n\nThough I may not be the first dietitian you’ve seen on IG, I’m likely the first Asian (and Hawaii born) dietitian you’ve seen and that’s because there aren’t many of us.  As a result, many people (and dietitians) aren’t familiar with many of our cultural foods which result in many of our foods being deemed as “unhealthy” or “gross”.\n\nIn honor of AAPI month, I’ll be doing a small series of Asian and Pacific Islander cultural foods throughout the month to increase awareness of these foods and how they can fit into a balanced diet.\n\nFirst, we’re making tamago kake gohan (TKG) or “egg with rice”, which is a classic Japanese breakfast food.  It’s one of the quickest and easiest foods to prepare and is so savory due to the seasonings used.  You’ll get protein from the eggs and carbohydrates from the rice if you have the dish by itself, but I recommend adding nattō (fermented soybeans) to increase protein and fiber content!  \n\nMost importantly, there are a lot of misconceptions around MSG and the biggest one is that it’s horrible for us and that Chinese restaurant syndrome is legitimate even though decades of research have disproven this.  A lot of these misconceptions are not rooted in science, but rather racism.  \n\nIn the 1960s, a doctor reported numbness and palpitations after eating Chinese food and playfully dubbed it “Chinese-Restaurant syndrome”.  This caught on very quickly, very likely due to the anti-Chinese sentiments in the United States in the 1960s.  MSG, an ingredient often used in Chinese (and Asian) cooking was initially blamed which prompted many researchers to study MSG.  However, no negative effects were found.  The only study that did find something negative was when they injected rats with extremely high doses of MSG (we’re talking 500x the amount that the average human consumes).

You do increase your risk of salmonella if you’re in the US and eat unpasteurized raw eggs. \n\nThough I may not be the first dietitian you’ve seen on IG, I’m likely the first Asian (and Hawaii born) dietitian you’ve seen and that’s because there aren’t many of us.  As a result, many people (and dietitians) aren’t familiar with many of our cultural foods which result in many of our foods being deemed as “unhealthy” or “gross”.\n\nIn honor of AAPI month, I’ll be doing a small series of Asian and Pacific Islander cultural foods throughout the month to increase awareness of these foods and how they can fit into a balanced diet.\n\nFirst, we’re making tamago kake gohan (TKG) or “egg with rice”, which is a classic Japanese breakfast food.  It’s one of the quickest and easiest foods to prepare and is so savory due to the seasonings used.  You’ll get protein from the eggs and carbohydrates from the rice if you have the dish by itself, but I recommend adding nattō (fermented soybeans) to increase protein and fiber content!  \n\nMost importantly, there are a lot of misconceptions around MSG and the biggest one is that it’s horrible for us and that Chinese restaurant syndrome is legitimate even though decades of research have disproven this.  A lot of these misconceptions are not rooted in science, but rather racism.  \n\nIn the 1960s, a doctor reported numbness and palpitations after eating Chinese food and playfully dubbed it “Chinese-Restaurant syndrome”.  This caught on very quickly, very likely due to the anti-Chinese sentiments in the United States in the 1960s.  MSG, an ingredient often used in Chinese (and Asian) cooking was initially blamed which prompted many researchers to study MSG.  However, no negative effects were found.  The only study that did find something negative was when they injected rats with extremely high doses of MSG (we’re talking 500x the amount that the average human consumes).  If you inject any rat  with 500x the amount of anything that a human consumes, it will likely have negative side effects regardless of what you inject it with.  \n\nMSG is derived from glutamic acid which is an amino acid that naturally occurs in many foods such as tomatoes, cheese, and mushrooms.  The glutamate in MSG is chemically indistinguishable from glutamate present in these foods, and our bodies metabolize both sources in the same way.\n\nLastly, MSG actually has less sodium than salt despite providing SO much more flavor.

181,FaGnvfxTPPA,"['There is more to the story than “just eat more protein” when it comes to satiety. And it’s not just about the protein. There is more nuance to this subject and more than one factor when it comes to satiety.\n\nThe totality of the data on the subject (much which she is ignoring) suggestions that food volume to calorie ratio (how calorically dense the food is or isn’t relative to other foods), the fiber content, protein, AND texture are all key factors contributing to how satiated someone is. In other words, the overall food matrix is more of a factor than just one component such as protein.\n\nThis is why, for example, if you look at the satiation index of foods, a low protein food such as a potato ranks way higher than any animal high protein food, despite being a low protein food in of itself.\n\nAnd newer data suggests that the texture of a food is a major factor as well. For example, you can have two foods that are high protein (yogurt vs chicken breast or lean fish), and the lean protein will be far more satiating calorie for calorie than the yogurt will. This is because despite having similar protein values, one has a very soft texture and the other has a harder more complex texture and that protein takes longer to break down to digest.\n\n\nSo it’s not just about “eat more protein.” If you’re dieting and making most of your protein consist of egg whites and dairy protein, you will NOT feel as satiated as you would if you had of swapped out those proteins for lean fish or chicken or lean turkey.\n\nThat’s not to say faster digesting proteins such as egg whites and dairy protein don’t have their place. They’re great when you need faster digesting proteins before working out or lighter proteins before bed, but making most or much of your protein from dairy and egg protein will leave you feeling less satiated compared to lean tissue proteins.\n\nAnd even then, using high fiber and high volume foods such as broccoli and potatoes or apples, oranges, berries, or melons to pair with your lean protein is best became then you’re hitting every point that contributes to overall greater satiety.\n\nBut just focusing on ‘eating more protein’ isn’t necessarily going to make you that more satiated.

But, anything you don’t allow your kid to have is exactly what they are going to want. And they’re going to find ways to get it. \n\nI grew up in a household with parents who I wouldn’t exactly call almond parents. But they were definitely close to being almond parents. There technically weren’t any foods that were off limits, and they even allowed us to have fast food every once in a while. But we were told to keep junk food out of the house and we were scolded whenever we ate too much of it. Kids at school often made fun of me for having “boring” lunches with no treats in them. Nobody wanted to trade anything with me. But I still found ways to get junk food from my friends, because I was pretty good at drawing from a young age, and I’d draw pictures for my friends in exchange for candy. I always hoped that eventually I’d grow out of my sweet tooth like everyone said I would, but honestly it only got worse as I got older. \n\nAnd now…sugar might as well be crack for me. Sugar addiction is a VERY real thing. And I’ve gained a significant amount of weight because of it. As soon as I went to college and realized I could eat whatever I wanted without the guilt that my parents would scold me, I just started eating all the junk food I could get my hands on.\n\nAnd now I regret it. I wish I hadn’t done that. I miss the beautiful fit body I used to have. And I’m trying to re-teach myself how to have a healthy relationship with food. Where I make good choices and only eat sweets in moderation.  \n\nBut that’s exactly why it’s important not to restrict. Because restriction can so easily lead to disordered eating. I think the best advice is to simply warn your kids what will happen if they eat a lot of junk food, but don’t tell them they’re not allowed to have it and definitely don’t scold them for having it. Treat junk food like it’s normal. But warn them of what could happen if they eat too much. And in a way that’s meant to inform rather than scare. The truth of the matter is that eating healthy just makes you feel better. It gives you more energy. It helps your brain to work better. Is supports your muscles and bones. It prevents disease. It helps to keep you fit. It helps you live longer. And that’s why you should want to eat healthy.  Meanwhile eating junk food is ok sometimes, but if you eat a lot of it all the time, you’re going make yourself look and feel more sick. And over time it may even lead to more serious problems. So it is up to you to know when enough is enough. You can eat whatever you want, and you will not be in trouble for eating candy or French fries or whatever else you want…but you should be aware of how you feel after you’ve eaten a lot of junk food vs how you feel after eating a lot of healthy food. And knowing what you know, you should make smart choices for your body.', 'Abbey is so freaking judgmental.

Calling it a trigger warning emphasizes its potential to be a problem to some and in my opinion,  can make a person more conflicted, and then being hard on themselves if they chose not to watch. I think just keeping it simple and describing what the video is about should be left as is without prefacing it as a possible trigger.', 'I agree that desensitization is the best plan for facing trauma, but the thing is that no one gets to decide when someone gets to confront their traumas except for the person in cause and their therapist. Doing it in the wrong way at the wrong time can make it worse, so I think trigger warnings should still exist in order to let the person decide if they want to confront their traumas then or not.', ""As someone who has severe anxiety, is autistic, has adhd and has struggled with SH in the past, I think they are definitely helpful. They give the person the forewarning to click away or prepare for what they’re about to see which I personally think is always a positive thing. Like if I’m having a bad time with my mental health and I see a trigger warning about SH, mental illness or even just loud noises I can decide to move past it, whereas if there is no trigger warning sometimes it’s fine and sometimes I feel caught off guard and exposed to content that causes me to spiral. Sure it does cause some people anxiety but that’s probably a sign that they should scroll away and I think a lot of those people would be anxious anyways if they were just exposed to the content unwarned, so wouldn’t they rather see it coming so they could avoid any further stress? At the very least I would say trigger warnings show compassion and thought for people with traumas and mental illness, so for me even if anxiety is induced it feels slightly less bad knowing that they were trying to be mindful about it.  \n\nSomething I do think is unhelpful and anxiety inducing though is when people put up trigger warnings without saying what it’s for, like just putting TW or something without anything else. Cause it’s not very helpful to be warned when you don’t know what you’re being warned for, and it’s stressful because if you do struggle with something then suddenly you might be like: oh god what’s about to happen or be said what if it’s (insert trigger). \n\nAlso something to think about is that trigger warnings aren’t just for people with mental illness or trauma, they're also for people with physical health conditions like photosensitive epilepsy or people with sensory issues (like myself as I’m neurodivergent) who can become easily overstimulated by loud noises or flashing images. Trigger warnings just provide a small level of preparation for triggering content or give someone a second to scroll away if they know it will be triggering, whether physically or mentally or both. \n\nI just think in my experience and from what I’ve heard from other people, they’re generally more likely to be helpful than they are to be unhelpful."", 'Triggerwarnings have helped me a TON. Yes, you have to confront yourself with your traumas to overcome them. But no, people on YouTube are not my therapists, and randomly scrolling YouTube is not the safe environment needed to start out with that. Trauma therapy involves a LOT of learning coping strategies, learning how handle the stress of facing your traumas first. This is not provided by the people that tell us to „just stop avoiding our traumas“. As a trauma survivor currently in therapy, I have the space to slowly learn how to deal with my triggers, but YouTube is not that space. So please keep giving us trigger warnings. Or content notes. I‘m not always in the stable mindset to be able to deal with unexpected triggers and I‘m thankful when people give me the chance to just keep scrolling and avoid panic attacks and flashbacks.', 'I think there’s excellent points here. Counter argument, we are very familiar with “viewer discretion” notices in media. I believe there is a point of balance somewhere in all this.', ""Maybe feels helpful for some people in the short term, but in the long term, I believe it is absolutely holding them back from becoming stronger and being able to face whatever it is that triggers them. The real world is unpredictable and doesn't come with trigger warnings; that will be a rude awakening to someone who practically lives online and is used to being warned of every twist and turn. Let's build up strong people💪🏻"", 'Desensitization has always been key to coping with trauma. You aren’t fixed when you don’t have to see the problem, you’re fixed when the problem doesn’t phase you.', 'Yes!  At some point we have to learn to have some coping skills and deal with the world as it is.', 'Speaking from my experience *only*, as someone who has experienced things like an active shooter, SA, ED, and loss of a parent, I find general warnings to be best. I feel like nowadays there are so many super specific trigger warnings tagged onto things. I think keeping TV warnings like language, sex, violence, is general enough to get a point across. Reiterating the specifics of triggers could possibly cause people to hold onto their trauma and even make it a part of their personality when it’s healthier to live with it not in it.', ""I find them much more helpful than harmful. \n\nAs an autistic person, I don't do well with surprises, or unexpected things happening, and a trigger warning, even if it's not even for a topic that triggers me personally, helps me anticipate and regulate my expectations accordingly. \n\nIt's like if I'm going to an event it's extremely helpful for me to know ahead of time if there will be bright lights, or a lot of noise, so I can pack my shades and ear defenders to protect myself. \n\nSure, a warning might be worse for some people, people are extremely complex and diverse, but I feel discouraging trigger warnings is something that will cause extreme harm to accessibility online and, in my opinion, a world without trigger warnings is much worse than one with them."", 'Yes they have. I said what I said and I’m not changing it. I know what I’m about to watch before I clicked on it because of the title of the video.

The word DIET means the kind of food someone habitually eats, not loss weight.', 'I personally think they are much more helpful than harmful. I suffer from ED but when I get your trigger warnings at the beginning of the video, it allows me to prepare. If I didn’t feel like I was ready for that content, I wouldn’t watch. In my own past experiences when there wasn’t a trigger warning, (not a video of yours) I can’t mentally prepare myself. It led to times where I had to turn off a video. I personally like having a pre warning on the content so I know if I can handle it or not. It’s like knowing the dog dies in the film, if I know right in the beginning then I can prepare myself']",23

At the end of the day, food is food is food. Eating only ""healthy"" foods is also an eating disorder, people (orthorexia). VERY few people would be content without having the occasional slice of cake or pie or whatever treat is deemed as unhealthy. The only thing that\'s unhealthy about those foods is the lack of balance--if you eat 1000 Cals worth of cake, for example, you\'re going to get all the sugar and fats and carbohydrates you need but you probably won\'t have room to crave anything else, which is not ideal only because you need protein, dietary fiber, other vitamins and minerals that cake doesn\'t provide.

And then we were talking about at home and I said “I heard Coconut oil is better. Is there anything you can tell me about it.” And he said “The research on coconut oil is incomplete. My honest suggestion is just to stay away from fats that are solid at room temp. Vegetable oil, canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, they should all be fine. If you can’t afford the pricier stuff just stick with vegetable oil and don’t go deep frying all your food in it.” \n\nSo I did.\n\nAnd my cholesterol did drop significantly, though I’m still too high. A lot of my issue is just genetic. So every diet I tried didn’t really help, it would drop maybe 3 or 4 points and that’s not enough to really tell if it’s actually the diet helping. So I went back to eating how my mother taught me to eat, stopped worrying about it cause I figured if it’s genetic there’s not a HUGE amount I can do about it without medical intervention. And now my cholesterol is pretty consistently in the low 200s without meds. Perfect? No. Better? Much better.', 'Oil does change the taste and make it denser so I recommend adding 2 vanilla puddings instead! It’s tastier and not as dense!

The studies that I have read have suggested that inflammation related to seed oils and food in general is very individualized. However, they had found a lot of people were reacting in an inflammatory way to seed oils.\n If you pay attention to the intuitive eating mindset, you will probably realize for yourself whether or not foods are causing inflammation for you. I can't have nightshades. And I can't eat beets. Everybody's different."", 'okay but I thought we all knew from day one that vegetable/seed oils are bad. like, without hearing it from influencers.', 'Colleen, please edit your content, it’s important recognize that you have a very large following of people with restrictive EDs. Maybe for someone with BED, asking questions before eating would help, but with anorexia, the goal is to eat, and eat with freedom, with bulimia it’s to eat enough and not purge after, and with orthorexia it’s to challenge food and behaviors that scare you. But asking those specific questions can add more restrictions, so I there needs to be seperation between who your content is for. Please, don’t keep posting videos of you smearing food on yourself and saying you’re character binged. Binging is rough, it’s hell, but spreading the stereotype of it always being messy is so wrong, there’s already so much stigma around it, okay? Maybe it’s not something you went through, but it made me so upset to see, I cried for an hour after. You already feel embarrassed enough after, and if you’re trying to restrict, like if you have anorexia, the lack of control in another aspect of your appearance besides a bloated stomach is so terrible to see. The stereotype of bulimics being messy is so harmful, and only contributes to the hierarchies within ED communities. Please don’t keep posting these videos of, “an XYZ is not a brownie” and give the recipe, my ED brain saw that and said “opportunity…?” The idea is very good, but giving the recipes really isn’t, especially because if you do have a restrictive ED, seeing a fictional character who has one fear a food makes it worse. When I was trying to find recovery content, and I saw people challenging fear foods, I felt worse after. If they were scared or changing it, should I? Maybe I wasn’t sick enough? It can give others ideas as well, some might even find ways to make it seem as if they’re eating more. And maybe don’t villianize the black clothed person, it hurts because that character and manifestations in real life have been hurt by diet culture as well. The way you stigmatize disordered eating and disorders is so cruel, and it hurts okay? No one pre ED wants anorexia, bulimia, orthorexia, and we all reach a point where we want out, why not be kind and educate politely? I understand how frustrating it can be! I promise I do. Often when I see clearly disordered people, I look and think, “that’s crazy!” I do it when looking at my old habits, but please remember that they’re hurting as well. By coming across as condescing it makes someone like me who is self aware feel even more stupid. I understand lemon water is a scam, but it’s a safe drink of mine and I know that in itself is an issue. By making it condescending though when speaking on it, it can make people seem worse, who knows, you might even miss out on clients because of it, it made me hesitant to take your advice. Plus, maybe those things are safe foods or ways to challenge scary foods. Maybe putting sprinkles on an apple and chocolate isn’t a don’t, but someone might do it to challenge the chocolate and sprinkles, maybe it’s a stepping stone, and that’s okay! Baby steps are valid as a form of recovery. And maybe rephrase the “not dieting” videos. I think that’s a good intention, and something people aren’t aware might be disordered, it’s good you see and help others! However, it’s very valid as recovery, if I hadn’t had it, I would’ve had a lot more trouble getting over fear foods and behaviors, it can make you feel safe again around food. It’s also essential sometimes to weight restoration. Your body needs the proteins and carbs and fat it was lacking. It needs those calories, you’ve essentially just come out of a famine the way your body reads it. To many it’s essential, and challenging it as such with wording might scare people away, so maybe be careful and revise that one portion. That stage isn’t forever, but hopping from it to quickly makes you vulnerable to a relapse, and it might even make clients have unreal expectations. Recovering without that might make them think they won’t gain as much, and when the eventually do, or binge, it can scare them off from recovery, when really they should be challenging that weight gain! It can really mess up people mentally. And for some, it IS intuitive, their body needs those calories. I feel like almost stigmatizing it sort of mocks a form of intuition that for them is helpful, afterall intuitive eating looks different for everyone. You might also need to change some of the recipes you post, that pancakes cup was small, and I guess I had hoped it would be bigger, for many that’s not breakfast! It might even border pro Ana, and attract a very ill, but toxic crowd. Also, I know you and me have similar pasts, okay. I wouldn’t want to ever count calories, you probably shouldn’t either, that’s fine. But for many, weight loss is healthy, and for health! It’s okay, and if counting calories is a way for them to do it, it’s okay. I’m to type A for it, but some do okay, the stigma around things that to you or me might be disordered can really turn people away from what may be healthy for them. Also, I assume you weren’t even in pro Ana spaces, so I figured I would tell you. Love, with all due respect, the way Abbey, Sohee, and Kylie use body checks is WRONG. Of Herbs and Altars made a good video, but it’s something anorexics and bulimics did for comfort like stimming, OR was a way to mark progress, often done in skimpy clothes or at odd angles as a form of validation. Such as not having a tummy when bent over. I’ve heard you use the word like that, but to someone like me it’s an accusation of an ED and is really serious. I don’t always like Chloe Ting, but she doesn’t body check. Usually you only see that in very shady spots online. Showing off your body to make money or sell an image the way they do it isn’t body checking. The way the term is used now dilutes its power, so if you would use something else, that would be much appreciated. Also, maybe reevaluate how you discuss not intuitive eating? If you have a restrictive ED, you can die if you try to eat intuitively, and be disordered and hide it with that. It’s obviously more than just hunger cues and stopping when full, but that’s what it’s most known by. Being condescending towards other forms might still turn others away, we’ve all been hurt by diet culture. It’s important to recognize that for some, where their at, even if disordered is PROGRESS, and not always being careful with wording can I take away from that. hope you take my advice, and continue to try and help others :)', ""honestly i don't like seed oils bc if i eat too many my stomach hurts. if they work for you then great, but when i found out how they were made i got even more grossed out by them. i eat intuitively and part of that for me at least is eating less seed oils bc i think they're gross and when i eat them a lot i feel gross."", 'You know what I realised, the One in black wears clothing that makes her look skinnier and fitter while the other where’s looser less restrictive clothes.

Like clockwork, after a few weeks on keto, after the initial weight drop and once the sugar cravings started kicking back in, I’d binge HARD on sugar-dense things like Nutella by the jar, cakes, etc. Then I’d feel immense shame, and restart the keto cycle again. \nWhen I heard the phrase “A diet isn’t working for you if you’re constantly having to ‘get back on it’”, I abandoned the mentality that keto or low carb diets were the only way I’d lose weight and feel healthier. Watching videos like yours have helped immensely, I eat a much more balanced diet now and don’t place as much importance on “off-limit” foods like I once did, because I know that I can have them whenever I want.

Normal eating is mostly three meals a day, or four or five, or it can be choosing to munch along the way. It is leaving some cookies on the plate because you know you can have some again tomorrow, or it is eating more now because they taste so wonderful. Normal eating is overeating at times, feeling stuffed and uncomfortable. And it can be undereating at times and wishing you had more.\n\nNormal eating is trusting your body to make up for your mistakes in eating. Normal eating takes up some of your time and attention, but keeps its place as only one important area of your life. In short, normal eating is flexible.

Drinking water may help quench thirst, but it may not satisfy a craving for a specific food or nutrient. Moreover, cravings can be a sign of nutrient deficiencies or imbalances, so it\'s important to pay attention to them and address them appropriately.\r\n\r\n""If you can\'t control yourself around food, keep it out of the house"": This advice promotes a restrictive, all-or-nothing approach to eating that can be counterproductive and unhealthy.
