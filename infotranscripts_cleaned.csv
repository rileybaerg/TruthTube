0,do8O1YxzdVg,if you don't like eating veggies this video is for you as a dietitian one of the most common things I hear is that people don't like vegetables and honestly I totally get it which is why I always recommend preparing them in different ways for example make a chopped salad box and use this as a dip for your chips I'm using cabbage cucumber broccoli avocado I'm just going to top this with chickpeas and pumpkin seeds and now I'm just going to coat all of the screen goodness and the screen goddess dressing I came up with that line that was pretty bad wasn't it store bought dressing because I'm not in a Gordon ramps kind of mood don't worry if you're the same way using sore bought dressings will not take away from the nutrient density of your meal now we're just going to shake now just top of chives and now you should have a green goddess chopped salad box dip this way you're still getting in all the fiber nutrients and fats but sometimes having a chop that small and eating it with a chip can make it easier and more fun to eat so easy and so good I like all veggies but in this case I like them smaller that's what she said 
1,bpsKYwQffes,if you are not freezing your rice this is your sign to start I'm a dietician and welcome back to realistic nutrition tips if you love having grains like rice and quinoa with your meals but it takes too long to cook freeze them in portions and heat them up later you might have heard that reheating rice is dangerous and can make you sick because of bacteria called pilos serus which can cause vomiting and diarrhea also popularly known as fried rice syndrome but this has been blown way out of proportion and I say this is someone who's obsessive about food safety is Serve Safe certified took many food science courses is Asian and has thoroughly studied every single type of food poisoning since I used to be an extreme and metaph Bic and stuff like this used to keep me up at night not the reheating of the rice that makes people sick it's all about how it was stored beforehand after you make something like rice just don't leave it out for too long at room temperature because that's what makes any food not just rice risu because bacteria can grow more rapidly at those temperatures all you have to do is cool your rice and Portion it out I'm using these 1 cup silicone molds so portions are easier to manage then I just freeze them I'll do this for my leftover rice so I don't waste food and so I don't have to cook rice every time I want to eat it I'll just add it to my rice container and whenever I want rice I'll just pop it in the microwave freezer rice 
2,9RO83PiuQ-A,if you don't like cooking and washing dishes but still want a delicious meal then make a one pot meal in your rice cooker I'm a dietician and welcome back to realistic nutrition tips this tip can be extra helpful if you're a college student someone with limited kitchen space or even if you're an elderly person who can no longer use the stove all you need to do is add your rinsed rice and water to a pot and add some veggies like carrots and bok choy you don't have to use these specific veggies you can really use any veggies you want add some edamame and Tofu for protein then make your sauce this easy soy Bay sauce is going to be Savory and so delicious then we're going to mix it drizzle our sauce over everything turn our rice cooker on and relax until it's done after about 20 minutes you'll come back to the most delicious easy meal if you're feeling extra fancy top it off with some green onions and sesame seeds and since I can just set it and forget about it it gives me more time to do other things like rot in bed or headit up your mom best part you can eat it right out of the pot which means let's clean up so easy 
3,dI-Be4IehyQ,you've heard of sheep pan dinners but have you heard of sheep pan breakfasts just like any sheep pan meal there's less cleanup because everything Cooks in one place and for me breakfast feels extra satisfying when it's Savory hot and freshly cooked so this has become a go-to especially since it's a lot easier to prepare than it looks for fiber we of veggies like onion and bell peppers sweet potatoes are also a great source of fiber and energy rich carbohydrates but the star of this meal is eggs not just because they're a high quality source of protein but also because they deliver key nutrients that most Americans don't get enough of such as choline like most people you may be Wonder wondering whether you should be worried about the cholesterol and eggs and that question is exactly why I'm teaming up with the American Heart Association though many people used to be worried about dietary cholesterol current research shows that dietary cholesterol found in eggs doesn't have as big of an impact on total cholesterol and that eggs can be part of a healthy diet according to the American Heart Association healthy people can include on average seven eggs per week as part of a heart healthy diet so if you're looking for a filling delicious breakfast lunch or dinner try the sheet pan meal and remember that eggs can be part of a healthy diet 
4,O_7ZvwhzqGg,if you like salads but hate preparing them this video is for you a few months ago I posted a video about using a veggie Chopper to make a salad box in then I've gotten a lot of messages from people asking about what different salads to make so let me show you one of my favorites first you're going to chop napa cabbage then red cabbage now let's add cucumber carrots red bell pepper and chicken for protein as a dietitian so many people tell me that they don't stay full after salads and usually the reason is because they're not eating enough protein and or fat speaking of froin I'm also going to add in edamame now I'm going to use the California Pizza Kitchen tie dressing if you couldn't already tell this salad is basically the CPK Tha crunch salad which is my favorite salad from there a gentle reminder that the dressing does not take away from the nutrients in the salad it's going to help you enjoy eating your veggies and eat more of it than it's a win now we shake this I'm going to top this off with some peanuts Chi noodles I love a little Crunch and cilantro now we have ourselves the most delicious salad box 
5,Nq0cKpBQq-I,I'm a dietician and this is what I atat for breakfast this is truly one of my favorite things to make first crack two eggs into a bowl mix in 3/4 cup of water and a pinch of salt SC into a bowl and cover with Saran Wrap and steam for 12 minutes I brought water to a boil in a w placed my bowl on a steamer rack and covered it but you can steam this however you want now it's top with soy sauce sesame oil and green onions this is optional but you can cut through the egg to let the sauce seep through I'm having this with leftover rice and kimchi and it was so so good if you're looking for an easy meal 
6,y6Z8a0CXfuI,let's make a side dish for our Thanksgiving dinner I haven't spent Thanksgiving home in Hawaii in over 10 years but tonight I'm going to the next best thing which is my childhood best friend's boyfriend's familyes friend's house and it sounds confusing at first but my best friend who I've known since elementary school started dating this really nice guy who's really nice family happens to be Japanese and from Hawaii just like me and my friend they've been inviting me to their holiday get togethers because they're so kind and also because they know how isolating it can be without a family when you're far away from home so they've adopted me which I truly appreciate and to make things even more exciting we have the same taste in food because of our similar cultural backgrounds AKA they also have rice noodles and other Asian food at these dinners so for Thanksgiving I wanted to make a traditional Thanksgiving side dish for a Japanese flare I decided to make spicy Misa glaz brussels sprouts and you have to trust me on this because I didn't record anything at this dinner out of respect for their privacy but it was so good and they were thankfully a hit 
7,2lnzGCLgYyk,for years I struggled to eat meals because even though I had all of the ingredients for a meal I just didn't have the energy or capacity to put it together not just because I had untreated ADHD and lacked the executive function to do so but also because I was depressed what I'm about to tell you is something that helped me get out of my slump if you don't have the energy to make a sandwich you can still eat the parts so snack on a few slices of turkey this will give you protein to help you stay satiated have a few slices of cheese this will give you some calcium some fat to digest fat soluble vitamins and also happiness because cheese is the best don't forget the bread this is carbs which give you energy have an apple or maybe some baby carrots whichever one's easiest for you both give you some Fiber which will help you stay regular I know it seems like obvious advice but remembering this on hard days really helped me feel my body because it made meals seem more manageable and I believe that's what girl dinner was all about still eating enough to fuel your body but not having the energy to do more than that and that's okay don't get down on yourself for not having the capacity to assemble food to look a certain way especially if it's going to look all the same to your body 
8,vwOTxAGg_CY,if you like salads but hate repairing them this video is for you I'm a dietitian and welcome back to realistic nutrition tips instead of taking the time to chop everything individually just add everything to a veggie Chopper and don't empty it along the way just make your entire salad in here this video will have an easy chopped salad without the mess and energy of preparing it there's this girl on here that's been doing this and I think it's an excellent tip for people with ADHD people with chronic illness and people who just don't like to chop things or wash dishes I've had my veggie chopper for more than two years and this really helps me get in more vegetables like having my whole salad in here is just so helpful also salad Just Hits different when it's chopped I don't make the rules also gonna add some grilled chicken because it helps that too and also I want some protein after you're done add your toppings I'm adding some feta some sunflower seeds in my dressing now I'm just gonna put this back on and give this a shake and now you have an easy Chopped Salad such a quick salad and so easy to prepare 
9,3Ql8lfCMEIg,I'm a dietitian and I'm having dinner nuggets for lunch and I'm gonna tell you why welcome back to the series where I show you what I'm eating and why and I can already see the comments saying Kylie you're a dietitian why are you eating dinner nuggets that's so unhealthy as a formerly picky eater dinner nuggets were my absolute favorite food as a kid and although I've since Diversified my diet there are occasionally times when dino nuggets just hit the spot plus they're so convenient so let me show you what we could add to them first quickly purpose salad kit you can use any but today I'm feeling this one then I'm going to take my warm whole wheat tortilla add as much veggies as I can for more of that fiber which is going to keep me Fuller and regular then I get my dino nuggets which have some of that protein which is going to keep me more satisfied you can add more of the dressing or another sauce to this before wrapping it up but now you have a crispy chicken wrap that's a little more filling and nutritious also remember what you can add to not what you can subtract from your meals

65,QGor7f96ai8,I'm back home in Hawaii let's make chapty for a Christmas dinner today making chopje which is a popular Korean dish with vegetables and noodles and I really wanted to make it for my fiance Alex whose favorite dish is chop Jay and for Alex's Korean Grandma who is also going to be at this Christmas dinner I remember meeting her for the first time over seven years ago and she brought chopche to my very first Christmas dinner with her family as the head of a Korean and Puerto Rican household she often made traditional dishes like chop Jay and pasteles and I always admired how she like many other Asian grandmas showed her love through cooking even if the dish she was cooking was a dish she was initially unfamiliar with and now that she stopped cooking as often I'm hoping to get back to her what she's giving others and make something that I know she'll love I was initially nervous because it was my first time making this but I'm happy to say that it was a success 
66,-UZpmlhPiR0,everything I ate on my flight home to Hawaii for dinner I had this garlic pesto and diced tomato chicken bagel roll with Maui style chips and a Honolulu Cookie Company cookie The Bagel rule is fine basically everything you would expect but I did love this cookie more a few hours later I got hungry so I put out my travel snack pack and this is what I pack I try to bring snacks that are easy on my stomach but this should be enough protein and fiber to keep me full I then passed out for the rest of the flight and then I landed just kidding it did not look like this when I landed because it was nighttime and you couldn't actually see anything but I felt like you deserved a better view than this but either way I'm so excited to be home let me know what videos you want to see while I'm here 
67,n7GoqHolyLk,what I ate at the unforgettable Gala which is an annual Gala that celebrates aapi leaders like simulu Batman Rock Sandra Oh Stephanie Shu Chloe Kim and many more first I started off with this delicious Sesame salad honestly any salad with Sesame automatically wins in my book and bretman himself even said it was so good then I had the Miso glaze black cod which was flavorful and light and now I want to recreate this at home stay tuned the last thing I had was this espresso almond tiramisu cup for dessert and the cup was chocolate I know I'm easily impressed but I really enjoy this it was honestly such an incredible experience to be surrounded by people in the aapi community that I've always admired and I'm just feeling grateful inspired and very full 
68,Nq2NqlazqBA,let's make food for a picnic let's start with preparing our tuna speaking of tuna I used to hyperfixate on tuna sandwiches from Subway as a kid and I would always get the worst stomach aches after eating them and one day my dad watched me eat a tuna sandwich and he realized that I had the entire six inch tuna sandwich in under three minutes and she was like whoa you gotta stop eating so fast and I listened to him and that's the story of how my dad cured my eighth grade stomach issues weirdly enough I haven't had a tuna sandwich since so I'm excited for these now we're gonna do a lentil Brusque with the balsamic glaze so first we're gonna cut the tomatoes and then I'm kidding pre-made from Trader Joe's because we don't have time for that today now I'm gonna drizzle with glaze and I think I'm going to top it with basil let's taste test it to make sure it tastes good guys yay [Music] just give me the grape no no wait wait 
69,EcUmgWbzMmU,I'm a dietitian and this is what I eat for breakfast first I boil my eggs for six minutes and then transfer it to cooled water then I mix together soy sauce water garlic honey jalapeno pepper green onions and sesame seeds then I add the eggs to a container refrigerate overnight and the next morning I add it to leftover rice drizzle some sauce and add kimchi it only takes a few minutes and it's so good if you're looking for an easy meal 
70,HtmeDIp4QhY,I'm a dietitian and this is day three of realistic nutrition tips if you can't stand cooking and the idea of cooking vegetables stresses you out get one of these to microwave steamer and it's going to make your life so much easier all you have to do is put water in this compartment put this on top on top and then put your veggies on top all I have to do now is close the lid and put this in the microwave cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the food that you're cooking but this should take around three minutes okay it's been three minutes perfectly steamed broccoli you can literally do this for all kinds of vegetables and it's so much easier and quicker especially if you just want to get vegetables on the table 
71,Hx5LMQdtmK8,how I get my hair from this to this with no heat first I put my heatless curling rod on my head then I roughly divide my completely dry hair into small sections and wrap each section around the rod I work my way down and tie my elastic tight around the rod then just do the same thing to the other side I'm going to sleep on this and wake up the next morning and all I have to do is release the clip take off the elastics and take out the rod I gently run my fingers to my hair and I might blow dry my bangs but that is 
72,IfGp016IaBM,I'm a dietitian and this is what I eat for breakfast if you crave something Savory in the morning this is for you because I'm making Savory oats yes oats can be Savory and they're so much better this way I'm bringing chicken bone broth spinach and soy sauce to a boil then I'm just going to add my quick oats for one minute before finishing it off with oyster sauce I'm topping it off with an egg for additional protein and chili oil for a little kick if you're looking for an easy meal 
73,8gIWivpcAfw,so apparently grapes tossed in lime juice and Jello powder are supposed to taste just like sour candy I'm a dietitian and we're gonna try this out so I have washed grapes here and now I'm just going to coat this in lime juice so now I'm adding the strawberry jello powder to this container and the orange yellow powder to this container here's what my strawberry grape looks like and here's what the orange one looks like okay moment of truth let's try it out that was actually pretty good so this can actually be a fun way to get in more fruit and it can actually be a little more filling than candy because it has a little more of that fiber but I wouldn't say that this is just as delicious as sour candy although this could be an alternative that's lower in added sugars both this and sour candy can have a place in your diet 
74,6shs5fSofi8,I'm a dietitian and I have IBS let's get my IBS friendly meal for when I'm not feeling well first let's make the marinade for a chicken now we're gonna let this marinate while we prepare our rice and bok choy I'm making white rice because it truly is my stomach's best friend in times like these though I'm used to it it does suck to have IBS because it can limit your diet and make you feel like you're missing out on Foods experiences and opportunities but I have learned that it is possible to adjust your diet and lifestyle to reduce your symptoms foreign here we have a Thai Basil cilantro chicken with bok choy and rice it's delicious and it won't hurt my insides

118,zXfKuvuRRu8,today i'm going to share with you what i tell people when they say they want to start eating healthier you want to focus on adding not subtracting which means you want to focus on what you can add to your diet instead of what you want to take away let's take this bowl of cereal most people look at this and think i should really stop eating carbs but instead of thinking of what to take away let's ask ourselves what are we missing protein keeps us satiated so we want to make sure we're having this with all of our meals an easy and popular example would be milk because it's a complete high quality protein that's why we feel fuller and satiated for longer when we have milk and cereal together the second thing we want to add is fiber since many breakfast cereals may not have a good source of fiber let's add some fruits crushed nuts and seeds not only will fiber keep us fuller but it can help control blood sugar levels improve our gi health and lower cholesterol levels nuts and seeds also provide healthy fats which can also help keep you full and help with the absorption of vitamins a d e and k notice how our bowl is no longer just cereal we can still have our favorite carbs but perhaps it's part of a larger meal that will help us stay energized and satiated 
119,T-GfxayE67U,as you all know i'm a dietician and there's something that many of us have been hiding from the public that i want to come clean about what i'm about to show you is an extremely concerning study that many of us are trying to cover up because it basically discredits everything we've been saying and it also shows how much the government has been lying to you and i'm nervous about what's gonna happen to me after i post this video but you guys deserve to know the truth but here it is

144,9kyeawQti6M,me making myself soup every day after finding out how easy it is so i'm a japanese dietitian and this is how i make miso soup in five minutes by endashi and four cups of water and bring to a boil once it's boiling you're gonna want to reduce the heat this is important because boiling miso can make it lose its flavor and nutrients then strain three tablespoons of miso through a mesh strainer i highly recommend this one and you're gonna add your wakame soft tofu and green onion and that's it i will never get tired of how good this is 
145,NysjTea3V9A,shhh 
146,XhxuutNo2Xw,i'm a dietician and let's review what these doctors ate for lunch i love a good soup especially during the winter and i like that the soup has some protein and a lot of veggies okay whoever is having filet mignon for lunch is obviously doing something right with their life but i'd add a starch like potatoes or whole wheat bread for more energy these doctors have some nice meals this looks great broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable high in vitamin c fiber and antioxidants someone said that zero should take memory pills instead of supplements and i completely agree i encourage food before supplements and i would love to see daryl have some sort of meal liliana's got a lot of fiber there which is great but i'd recommend adding some protein so she stays satiated throughout the day okay her meal looks colorful and delicious quinoa has a whole grain that's high in protein so love seeing the meals this looks easy and delicious but i'd recommend adding a veggie like green beans or bell peppers or whichever veggies you like 
147,a4o4XGOSGcI,how do i eat healthy and lose weight well you want to eat fruit but not too much because fruit has a lot of sugar and sugar is bad for you avoid carbs because it's bad for you and raise blood sugar levels but also carbs are your body's main source of energy you have to eat every few hours so boost your metabolism but also try intermittent fasting and go 16 hours without eating to help you lose weight going gluten-free will help reduce inflammation and help you lose weight but also gluten is not inherently bad for you and there's no reason to avoid it if there's no medical reason to don't eat eggs because it raises your cholesterol but also eggs are a great protein source and you should have it with breakfast lastly fat makes you gain weight but keto a high fat diet will help you lose weight does that make sense

150,8WREPQNfyq0,if i told you you can eat this and still lose weight most people get stressed around this time of the year because they're scared to gain weight so they try different diets in order to lose weight the most common thing i see people do to lose weight is to cut foods out typically that food is carbs but what if i told you that you're focusing on the wrong thing what if i told you to instead focus on adding foods you may not be getting enough of there's a good chance you may not be eating enough protein or vegetables and these foods are key to staying satisfied sometimes we just need more balance in the diet rather than more restriction you deserve to look forward to meals rather than stress whenever you feel an ounce of hunger so next time you see one of these meals hopefully you won't be too confused when i ask

152,X7RWQeHHc6A,i'm a lazy dietitian and this is what i ate for dinner [Music] this is your sign to get over your fear of tofu and to cook it in a pan add in frozen veggies add in frozen fried rice you can use any fried rice but i highly recommend using this one because it adds so much flavor and that's it that's the whole meal we love an easy meal because

163,Ox3qUzijBxU,this is what i think about you based off of what your favorite food is i'm a dietician and this is my job so don't be offended if your favorite food is salad this is one of my favorites too you have great taste if your favorite food is peanut butter that's also one of my favorites too you have great taste if your favorite food is bread that's also one of my favorites you great taste if your favorite food is pizza though that's also one of my favorite foods you have great taste but if your favorite food is fries this is one of my favorite foods you have phenomenal taste 
164,wCuI5OrjhGI,welcome to another realistic non-diet what aena day as a dietitian started with my soy milk latte of course then I made some oatmeal with some protein powder in there added some peanut butter for healthy fats lots of berries some hemp Parts on top it is so satiating and so yummy love it for lunch I did a Sourdough sandwich with some pesto lots of avocado for healthy fats egg chicken put some cheese on there we loaded it up it was a big sandwich and I served that with hummus some carrots and some strawberries poppy enjoyed it too for dinner we ordered in I had a vegan udon noodle soup and some edamami I'm obsessed with that a mommy I ate the whole thing it's so good and for a bedtime snack I dove into the Lays family siiz bag of ketchup chips with some cottage cheese cereal and fruit yum 
165,e-xHZopzuUk,"things people have yelled at me for on the internet as a dietician number one saying that seed oils aren't complete poison number two eating unhealthy food or really anything that's not green juice salad or avocado toast folks having an occasional pizza night doesn't mean I have a junk diet number three saying that you probably need more than 1,200 calories a day for the vast majority of women young or older 1,200 calories is nowhere near enough number four if I even so much as hint at the fact that it's possible for a larger body folk to be metabolically healthy one of my goals on this app is to really invite everyone to reexamine their biases on that and finally when I say that diets usually don't work I talk about why weight loss is so hard to encourage dieters to exercise some self empathy and to demonstrate some of the key factors in what may lead to weight regain not to dismiss people's desire to lose weight "
166,LFrT3oEW02w,apparently this one original Crispy Cream dut has nearly 100 ingredients they also have Valentine's donuts for the day of love it would be very loving to give your loved one a donut that has nearly 300 ingredients and there's 25 g of sugar in just one doughnut calling this 300 ingredients is pure fearmongering since a lot of those ingredients are repeats because each component of the doughnut is being listed separately so for example we see sugar listed here and here and here and here and here and well in a lot of places because it's in the dut and it's in the frosting and it's in the filling Etc I'm not saying this is a simple ingredient list that I would recommend for daily consumption but for the most part people at least know that a Valentine's Day Crispy Cream doughnut is not the most nutritious everyday breakfast it's something that when enjoyed on occasion as a fun food though is not going to break your health so I really think that harping on the ingredients and sugar content on a specialty doughnut is a bit of a Captain Obvious moment and as nutrition communicators we have way bigger fish to fry next 
167,FaGnvfxTPPA,this is the most important piece of advice I can give hey everyone I'm Abby sharp I'm a registered dietician and there is a lot of shady extreme hyper restrictive weight loss advice floating around right now skip this meal cut out these Foods drink this tonic Etc that I'm all about a non-restrictive additive approach to food even when you're trying to lose weight so my top tip is to add more protein to every meal or snack protein needs are particularly High when in a calorie deficit with research suggesting that increasing the percentage of calories from protein from 15 to 30% resulted in eating 400 calories less and losing three times as much fat because we can utilize about3 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per meal or snack for muscle protein synthesis one of the most important habits you can get into today is prioritize protein at every meal ideally around 20 to 35 grams per sitting adding protein helps provide longer lasting stable satiety energy and blood sugar levels and increases the chances of weight loss success without scarcity or restriction this could look like adding a serving of chicken or tofu to meals and a scoop of protein powder or a bowl of Greek yogurt at snacks add don't restrict and make sure to hit that follow button for more no BS nutrition advice 
168,an8UREDhAFA,okay so I just bought a brand new ninja creamy Deluxe because my first one blew up so let's make protein ice cream I'm just going to add in our non-dairy milk here I'm going to do two full servings of our new Theory chocolate plant-based probiotic protein powder woo and I'm going to pop that in the freezer overnight and with the magic television we got one ready to go let's try to do this all right moment of truth oh my God got some free mini chocolate chips and a little swirl of peanut butter oh my god oh what what oh my gosh get in there guys we nailed it m the crunch 
169,2y8ZmEMOhVg,love me a wedding a day that doesn't start with a full-on body check okay so those eggs look amazing and I love that we've got protein fat and depending on what type of bread at least we're getting a little fiber in there too all right looks kind of like we're making a salad here we've got lots of crunchy lettuce and cucumber we got protein in our deli turkey healthy fats and fiber in the avocado and hummus so yummy spread on some flatbread we love it for dinner we got lots of and healthy fats in our salmon looks like we're making kind of like a peel off situation with the rice spinach for some extra fiber and antioxidants so simple and I'm sure super sa shating and dessert there's something so satisfying about a cup of hot chocolate with whipped cream especially in the dead of winter and those little cookie things oh my gosh they look amazing this day is Super nutritious balanced non-restrictive and inspiring to say the least and now I'm craving a little Whi cream next 
170,85PSwShkqiE,so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to take our donut pakas and our nectarin and we're going to cut them in half now for your jelly filling what we're going to do is we're going to take the jelly from one of your figs we're going to scrape it out and then we're going to put it in the middle of the dut so it tastes like raspberry jam sh together to make your jelly donut just like this okay no immediately no like there's nothing wrong with people calling recipes something cute because it looks like something else like zucchini noodles because they look like noodles or protein ice cream because it has the consistency of ice cream like whatever it's all semantics right these foods are just really fun ways of serving everyday food but they're not a replacement for the real deal so like no Christina a peach cut in half with fig guts in the middle is not a replacement for a donut peaches are delicious don't get me wrong but they're not jelly donuts next 
171,Dbr1o0Wo3rE,I love when you insert yourself into things that have nothing to do with you you don't have a goal body so why listen to you I am so glad I'm at a point in my life and my relationship with my body where I read a comment like this and I think wow I really feel sorry for that Troll And when one of my followers asked what is a gold body the troll replied one that's 20 lb lighter than hers she has zero muscle mass as well to be clear if I were to lose 20 lbs on my naturally slim frame I would be officially very underweight by BMI standards I definitely wouldn't have more muscle mass which tells me that I would need to be physically sick and now nourished for people on the internet like that to respect my evidence-based content this is what is wrong with Wellness culture on social media the lay person is more interested in following the advice of someone with zero credentials zero education as long as they are a size zero and aren't much more than 100 pound but also with ample muscle mass so yeah that nails down the candidate pool really fast folks my body is not my business card and I love the body that I have and I love this part even more and I really hope that one day you can find that same inner peace and more importantly stop embarrassing yourself online it's not cute next 
172,egjMGkzTLf8,[Music] I'm sorry what did I just watch who approved that ad like why are we putting young size zero women into shapewear not only is that probably not the target consumer like how dumb but it makes an already tiny woman look emaciated and that is not the vibe honestly some people need to not have jobs next 
173,eZWzSz2okXc,I love omad and I don't no but I'm glad this is working for Gabby but as a dietitian I'm not a fan of the omad diet and I'm going to tell you why it is next to impossible to get all of your micro and macro needs into one meal when you're losing weight specifically and you're in a calorie deficit protein needs are particularly High to prevent muscle wasting so generally speaking we're recommending about 20 to 30% of calories from protein or around 1.8 g of protein per kilogram of body weight to give you some rough numbers for a 200 lb person that is over 150 g of protein you would have to eat like 25 o of steak in one sitting and even if you managed to pack that in most of the protein would not be used for muscle protein synthesis we want to space our protein into 20 to 35 G doses or more specifically 4 G per kilogram per meal every 3 to 4 hours by eating only one meal a day you might be losing weight but there's a really good chance a chunk of that weight would be metabolic muscle and it is very very hard to get that back so yeah I'm going to pass on the omad diet next 
174,9ZU8GgDRQpA,this is wild Kelly rea's trainer just revealed exactly what Kelly eats in a day and honestly I am shook what has shook me to my core is that this diet is literally identical to what she posted on Harper's Bazar in 2020 that I responded to way back then in her Harper's bizarre food Diaries which got purposefully scrubbed from the internet due to backlash by the way she stated you were to ask me this one year from now I will have three entirely different meals but it will be the same rotation of meals for just about a year as I discussed on my video right here Kelly's team actually reached out to me asking me to remove the video that I posted because they claimed that this diet recall that she did was not an accurate representation of her real diet it was a cleanse day apparently a cleans day that now we see was actually her diet for over 3 years so here's hoping that Kelly's PR team makes light of this article too because yeah nobody needs to take these tips to Heart next 
175,EbH6w94J_ZE,If This Were my family and I was visiting for the holiday I would be putting this piggy in the microwave and setting the timer for just long enough for me to get the out of there no but seriously I think the saddest part about this video which has amassed well over a million views is that there are people in the comment section who are not just suggesting that they want to get this for themselves but that they want to buy this for their kids their children and people are liking that suggestion so folks research has made it Crystal Clear kids whose diets are heavily controlled and restricted are more likely to become overweight and obese as adults and they're also more likely to suffer lower self-esteem body dissatisfaction and depression if you think that mouthy piece of plastic in your cupboard is going to transform your kids into adult who love brussels sprouts and plain baked chicken breasts you are delusional sorry if I'm being a but the more I see like real life alond mom content and people applauding it the more ragy I get please parents do better next 
176,nm6HKabxdBw,[Music] all the millennial women who have been burned by D culture are like in the comments calling out their favorite Bagel orders because we grew up in a time when eating a bagel was equivalent to like screwing around with your high school best friend's boyfriend it was the ultimate betrayal it was a sin we were told to hollow them out and like feed the innards to the birds we were told to eat those thin ones which are not Bagels by the way they're just like thinly sliced bread with Hol in the middle we were told to put cream cheese on bell peppers instead and like shut our eyes and lie to ourselves that we enjoyed it abuse we have been abused so yeah now that we're on the other side we got a bagle in one hand we're like flipping die culture the bird on the other I would say yeah it feels exactly like that so keep on riding that wave my bagel buddies no one has ever taken that away from us again yeah 
177,x3-jCOGtEVU,get love this breakfast carbs and protein are really important for before any kind of physical activity like a big rehearsal I mean I might even add some fruit in there for some extra carbs to make sure she's really well fueled if she likes the taste of this great but this is probably one of my least favorite greens products in terms of actual benefits love that these bars have a really good balance of fats protein and [Music] carbs okay so lots of nutritious snacks throughout the day here which can be really helpful for a young ballerina because it can be very tough to meet your high nutrition needs in having just a few larger meals in the day and I like that we're getting in some sources of protein but also not sleeping on the carbs carb needs are incredibly High when you're maintaining that level of activity great hunger crushing combo plus some extra carbs at the end of the night to help replenish those glycogen stores so yeah I say this looks like a pretty great day for a dancer next 
178,IJq8W4ixR3Q,welcome to a body shot free day of eating we were shooting so I made a quick protein shake using my brand new theories 2inone plantas probiotic protein powder I was feeling like vanilla bean so that's what I went with today and I served that with some whole grain pancakes with peanut butter and fruit this is actually two full supplements in one and I'm telling you the flavor is unmatched lunch we did like a turkey Taco nachos on a b of veggies for like a crunchy taco salad sit situation I loaded it up with the guac and salsa poppy was obviously a huge fan she always is and for dinner I had a family favorite which was pizza chicken breast with some roasted bell pepper cauliflower and rice and then I did some caj cheese with some whipped cream and sprinkles for dessert and a couple of these super delicious tiny brown butter cookies oh my God they're so good 
179,CKsWRpCAci4,my 17-year-old daughter thinks I'm an almond Mom I don't think I am so let's do a pantry tour and you guys can decide I would say a pretty good litness test for whether or not you're an almond mom is if your kids believe that to be true based on their unrestrained experience with the rest of the world around them but let's take a look all right let's start at the top I always have a good selection of pasta and then that one is squash pasta I like to drink B bath almost like a tea this one is delicious I love this and regeneratively sourced blueberry bat last bar and it's made with cashews dates sunflower butter sweet potato and spinach I'm obsessed with a trail mix from Air1 like there my little tree has some chocolate pieces in it still have quite a bit of snacks I just nothing in here has any artificial flavoring there's nothing in it that's gross yep we can stop the analysis right there you have to ask the internet if you're an almond mom I think you have the answer in your heart next 
180,z1WYXX5bo_g,the supplement world is a broken industry it is truly the Wild West 
181,Jd3Z9F1sqjo,as a dietician I never drink or eat fat-free Dairy and since you asked I'm going to tell you why so it is true that most official nutrition guidelines still recommend low or no fat Dairy we're now learning that higher fat Dairy contains unique fatty acids like butyrate and other beneficial compounds like conjugated linolic acid vitamin D and gangliosides that may offer some protective effects that we miss out on when we go skim we also know that dairy fat may help deffer the insulin response that may be seen with lower no fat Dairy specifically for folks with insulin resistance PCOS and diabetes one 2019 systematic review found that most sources of full fat Dairy particularly fermented dairy did not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes consuming full fat Dairy has also been shown to reduce the risk of being overweight or obese by 8% and for women specifically emerging research has linked full fat Dairy to reduce risk of in ovulatory infertility whereas low or non-fat Dairy actually increased the risk and other research has found that fat-free Dairy is more likely to increase the risk of acne than full fat most importantly for me is that it is delicious and satiating which helps to reduce our need to fill the gaps with refined carbs m 
182,YoinrR3DsUM,every morning my mom drinks this 900 calorie drink that I think is absolutely absurd so she grinds up some almonds and pumpkin seeds because she says chewing it just too much work so she just grinds it all up and then she adds in some olive oil a lot of cre do this where they add in raw olive oil for the healthy fats along with some hem seeds protein powder she really likes this brand because it's just purely almond protein powder and some milk and that is her concoction we got loads of healthy fats and fiber in the nuts seeds hemp hearts and olive oil plus protein in the protein powder milk and like everything else I just listed like this is a Super Hunger crushing combo if I've ever seen M but because she doesn't like the taste of super healthy things she likes to have a chaser with it today it was her pickle dcon Rish with some carrots and some good old EG rolls and you're probably wondering why does she put herself through this misery it's because she doesn't want to eat this healthy thing all day she just wants it in one go I mean if choking down a goblet of flavorless Health porridge with a chaser of egg rolls works for Mom amazing I'm not going to mess with a system that works but she could also turn this into like a super tasty smoothie by just adding like a banana and some berries or she could cook the hemp and the nuts and the seeds with the milk into a porridge and then add in the protein put some fruit in there for flavor and some sweetness that said it's healthy as and if Mom is doing this daily she probably has a good long life ahead so definitely Abby approved 
183,fOn9OPilmRU,since when are rice cakes healthier than oats now don't get me wrong this looks like it could be really good I mean especially for you were to use one of those like caramel rice cakes yes please but nutrition wise I would take oats any day a/2 cup of oats contains 4 gam of fiber 5 gam of protein and 140 calories in contrast the two rice cakes that he used to this recipe does have fewer calories probably between 70 100 depending on the brand and variety but it has zero fiber and only 2 gram of protein so they might be lower in calories but they're going to have a much lower impact on satiety and a greater impact on blood sugars not to mention rice based products do contain arsenic so while there is little to no risk in enjoying rice products in moderation like I love me a little crunchy rice cake I would just be mindful if you're having these overnight rice cake oats things every day plus other rice based products in your diet never a bad idea to switch things up next 
184,XGxm0Kp0PjM,if you're trying to lose weight this is one of the simplest and most important things you can do one of the most evidence-based ways to support your weight loss without extreme restriction is to eat a high protein breakfast protein is King in the satiety hierarchy and the Apex of my Hunger cushion combo research has consistently shown that protein at breakfast helps reduce our hunger hormone grin increase our fullness hormones like peptide YY and glp1 aka the hormone that's manipulated by drugs like OIC and that these hormones are affected not just at that meal time but throughout the entire day day even in the brain on MRI scans we see that a high protein breakfast reduces the brain signals that control food motivation and reward-driven behavior the result is that we eat fewer calories over the course of the day creating a natural deficit even without any intentional calorie cuts that doesn't mean you don't eat carbs but it means that making sure you have a solid 20 to 35 GR in that morning meal can help to set you up for the day so whether it's eggs Greek yogurt cottage cheese scrambled tofu or protein shakes make starting your day with protein your number one goal 
185,FxqlFmnKvWE,does chewing gum release the same appetite suppressing chemical in weight loss drugs like OIC you know I was hesitant to respond to this question because I think it has the potential to encourage very disordered behaviors but you guys ask me about this a lot and I don't believe in censoring science so quick little trigger warning let's talk about it early small studies suggest that yes chewing gum can help to stimulate glp1 in the gut which is responsible for the appetite reduction scene on drugs like OIC it was also shown in another study where fullness levels were significantly greater and hunger levels were lower in the gum chewing group than the control now this was a super small study but it is consistent with other studies on gum chewing and Cravings plus more robust research suggesting that the slower we eat and the more we thoroughly chew our food the more satiated we are from the meal that said the difference in perceived hunger when chewing gum versus eating nothing at all is only like a 5 to 20% difference so this study is not suggesting that chewing a stick of gum will fill you up like you're still going to be hungry because you've eaten nothing at all please do not take this research as an invitation to like chew gum all day instead of actually eat next 
186,dZDWrgb49sw,more unpopular nutrition truths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know emergency is not going to cure your cold if you're chronically skimping on sleep a fruit smoothie may be less satiating than the equivalent amount of whole fruit but it doesn't mean that it's bad eating 8 lbs of raw food a day is not evidence of food Freedom you're more likely to get sick from stressing over every ingredient in your food than you are from the food grade Kagan in a Costco chicken suggesting fruit juice is as bad as soda is like equating zinc consumption with lead raw milk is not easier on the gut than pasture if anything it's going to do a number on the old gut when it causes foodborn illness which of these nutrition truths is going to make the most Wellness influencers mad 
187,pSycJYn4FBY,hi I'm Abby sharp and this is what a registered dietitian eats in a day obviously we had my soy milk latte and I had a random piece of fruit and a piece of cheese on my way to dropping the kids off at school then I got back home and I threw on my house uniform AKA my house coat then I made myself my protein cereal some protein powder and protein milk I added lots of different kinds of cereal some fruit some hemp Parts it is so damn good and stating for lunch I made chicken quesadillas and served it with some basic bagged salad keeping it super simple and easy on a workday and for dinner with stir fry I had some grown turkey lots of veggies some rice in there some for a khaki on top and some cashews and then we served it with some steamed buns and for bedtime snack I had a bowl of my favorite pink himalay and sea salt lesser evil popcorn it's so deliciously good and salty I had a random craving for some cheese so I had that with my fiber supplement and the rest of my bedtime supplements and medication and I went to bed that's it

206,1lOpWKa_p_U,seriously Tik Tok Tik Tok took down my video discussing my journey with Eden disorders because it violates Community guidelines took my video down because it promotes negative social comparison when this entire app is about social comparison yet I post a video of Hope discussing Eden disorders in an educational way sharing my story and you take that down yeah we need to talk about this the fact that I need to whisper the words when I am using my expertise and education as a dietician to take down damaging Pro content on this app no different than Michaela using her huge platform to share her experience recovering from her past and if we don't it gets flagged and taken down for violating Community guidelines and yet this content continues to rise and thrive in the algorithm what is going on here I am trying to lead the troops over to the safe side of Tik Tok but I can't do that if I need to censor everything that the video is about like how are my recovery friends going to even find me if I cannot mention recovery there are some days when I am just done 
207,f7zajNxkM9g,[Music] yeah I said what I said thanks to Tik Tok hormone girlies showing off their before and after shots of their tatas claiming that taking just a teaspoon of Bolen will increase their bus size but is this legit well what we know is that Bolen contains phytoestrogens which can bind to estrogen receptors in the body like breast tissue hypothetically stimulating growth but does it actually work probably not we don't have any randomized control trials yet looking at B pollen for boobs but a study of multiple different B species found that pollen didn't even interact with estrogen receptors in a lab model there's also way better sources of phytoestrogens in the diet so things like soy for example is a very rich dose and one that you would likely be consuming in much greater quantity than a teeny tiny spoonful of expensive pollen and we look at research on phytoestrin supplementation that was actually marketed for natural breast enhancement they found no evidence that it actually worked even at doses that were 250 times higher than recommended 
208,jc2y577esgY,lemon water is a SLE I love lemon water it's alkalinizing alkalizing alkalizing it's very good for the body good to flush out great to drink first thing in the morning first of all while lemon water does provide a bit of vitamin C probably around 12% of the recommended intake from the juice of half a lemon nothing we eat or drink can alkalize our blood or change our body pH the pH of our body is actually very tightly regulated period explanation point the end this popular Wellness culture concept is somewhat grounded in the fact that lemon is technically an acidic food but it increases alkaline byproducts once it's metabolized in the body but that just means it creates alkaline PE not alkaline blood not an alkaline body it changes our literal waste product because we do not need it otherwise H so if you like the flavor of lemon water amazing drink up but it's not a magic morning tonic and third doesn't flush out your body AKA detox first thing in the morning sure but so does literally any form of hydration all water is good water especially in the morning when you've gone a whole night without anything so yeah lemon lime bubbly Infuse whatever all water is a sleigh in my books 
209,G7_RSZVg_So,this is what I'm eating on my bulking diet this is just my lunch introducing carb City this is about the most inefficient way to bulk that I have ever seen to bulk you're going to want to likely be in a chloric surplus with carbs making up the majority of your calories followed by protein and then fat these two party size platters of green vegetables are about as low calorie and low carb as they come this is also to maintain stable levels of Baseline dopamine that's why I don't use dressing and I don't use meat or fat one of the main reasons why a lot of people are not successful at bu all the fat and protein mess up dopamine levels and they don't have motivation to exercise with authenticity the oh gosh no no no not exercising authentically is definitely not the reason why people have a hard time bulking nor should you avoid protein and fat in fact one amino acid tyrosine which is found in Turkey beef eggs dairy soy and legumes plays a critical role in dopamine production this video was so bizarre and problematic next 
210,5q_vSAOSgqA,I was betrayed by my own blood recently I found out that my middle child has been eating Supermarket choc chip muffins these things have over 20 ingredients in there and they're heavily processed my chocolate chip muffins are so much better they're nutritious they've hardly got any ingredients and I know what I've put in them I'm going to control his spending and stop giving him pocket money just have a look at these they're huge they're chocolatey they have everything that he could possibly need I mean no joke here your muffins look fire anytime you want a FedEx me some baked goods across the pond I will definitely pay the duties no problem but I feel like we don't need to freak out about this and like take your kids pocket money away a muffin with 20 ingredients may be slightly less nutritious than yours which has 13 ingredients but at the end of the day they're both mainly chocolate delicious yes but no one should be aiming to get their antioxidants fiber and protein from a triple chocolate muffin no matter what the ingredients are so I agree that homemade just always hits different and if you were my mom I assure you I would not betray you but big nutrition picture I feel we got bigger fish to fry next 
211,7H9VzqkG45A,"I'm doing a juice cleanse today I like to do juice cleanses after I purposely destroy my stomach decide to smoke lay in bed and eat 15,000 calories yesterday so I ordered a juice cleanse before I went to sleep getting a bit miserable ate a bowl of dry lettuce cuz I just needed to chew something so bad oh boy I have a lot to say about this one and know a juice cleanse is not the solution if anything this just further perpetuates and amplifies the binge restrict repent repeat cycle to purposefully ruin your gut only to try to then heal it by abstaining from any food insinuates a real All or Nothing Last Supper mentality around food where you're either binging and smoking in bed all night or you're making yourself miserable drinking green juices and chewing undressed lettuce because you desperately just need to chew something this is not a cute look I don't know why anyone with influence would want to share this journey cuz it's not the vibe so friends please do not intentionally overeat thinking you can just undo the damage with the juice cleanse because the more you restrict the greater chances of a repeat episode next "
212,TKc0upYf7xs,people who eat hard-boiled eggs for weight loss it works you know why because you're literally nauseous for the entire rest of the day basically # EG is the idea that eggs suddenly and unexpectedly start to taste like too eggy when you overeat them but I think the reason that this is such a phenomenon right now in 20123 is that a lot of people got into eating eggs during the pandemic we were working from home and avocado toast was all the rage and we had a lot more time to cook a breakfast at home instead of just like grabbing a latte and bagel on our way to the office so we are eating a lot more eggs so I would say that the primary reason for a lot of people's egg ick is just sensory fatigue and this can easily be mitigated by mixing up your protein sources or switching up how you prepare your eggs and if we're lucky after a little cool off period the eggi will go away hope that helps folks get cracken 
213,WL_Eqz7kRio,healthy lunch I could eat every day toasted seaweed I like the sheets so good for volume because it fills you up on the right stuff tuna and chicken salad so substantial um hey Bethany and Hi Bethany fans this seaweed wrap looks super delicious but this is just a friendly reminder from your no BS dietitian that carbs can be part of the good stuff too you're allowed to have carbs at lunch and this might be substantial and it might be voluminous and it might even make you physically full but there's a really good chance you're not going to feel emotionally satisfied and you know what that means yep 
214,bO_GGZZW28k,you've heard about boy math you've heard about girl math but let's talk about Wellness culture math if it contains GMOs it's toxic if it contains seed oils it's toxic if it contains GMOs and Seed oils but Haley Bieber was seen eating it it's a superfood and worth $50 it just m okay let's move on if you drink black coffee on an empty stomach in the morning you're spiking your cortisol and ruining your mental health if you drink black coffee on an empty simic in the morning to prolong your fasting window you are improving your mental Clarity and mental health basic math here guys keep up okay if you accidentally eat something with Red 4d in it you need to do a 3day liver detox if you accidentally drink a bottle of red you obviously need mimosas with the girls the next morning to De breath obviously and finally a store-bought smoothie is a sugar bomb and will spike your blood sugar but a smoothie from airan will possibly spike your Instagram followers if you post about it in your stories but only if you're wearing a matching ath leure set this is just basic math here folks 
215,CW8MTXpc1B4,things people have yelled at me for on the internet as a dietitian number one saying that seed oils aren't complete poison number two eating unhealthy food or really anything that's not green juice salad or avocado toast folks having an occasional pizza night doesn't mean I have a jug diet number three saying that you probably need more than 1200 calories a day for the vast majority of women young or older 1200 calories is nowhere near enough number four if I even so much as hint at the fact that it's possible for a larger body folk to be metabolically healthy one of my goals on this app is to really invite everyone to re-examine their biases on that and finally when I say that diets usually don't work I talk about why weight loss is so hard to encourage dieters to exercise some self-empathy and it demonstrates some of the key factors in what they lead to weight regain not to dismiss people's desire to lose weight 
216,gXalroA-J3U,more nutrition truths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know even though the world is obsessed with the risks of fatness you're actually twice as likely to die from being underweight than overweight a vegetable could fart on your cracker or chips and it can be labeled as made with real vegetables a fat-free salad may actually be less nutritious than one with a generous amount of dressing we need some fat to absorb the nutrients in those veg the added fiber in Your Greens powders or your keto candy is more likely to make you feel bloated than it is to keep you full or protect you from chronic disease canola oil actually has a uniquely favorable omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio it's only toxic to influencers because it's an accessible and non-exclusionary buy and full fat Dairy may actually be healthier than skimmed [Applause] fruits are going to make the most influencers mad 
217,D8ZyNJiemzI,how to manage your Halloween candy from your nobs register dietitian I really do see Halloween as a great opportunity to help neutralize the Laura sweets as forbidden Foods worthy of overeating so this is our Halloween candy protocol 101 step one allow yourself or your kids unlimited access to their Halloween candy on Halloween night if you or your kids are typically restricting sugar they probably will overeat and that is totally fine that's a teachable moment for them to feel that sensation in their body two allow another few days of unlimited candy post Halloween night one is an experiment but we really need to follow through with some consistency for our kiddos to really be able to trust that the goodies are not gone forever and their body signals can be trusted and then finally step three Implement a sweet Protocol no different than the rest of the year in my family this means my kids get to choose a piece for their lunch and or dinner so it's not like poof there's no candy ever ever again happy trick- or- treating oh good 
218,uEEFV7SkQYw,is what I've been doing to no longer poop water I've been having this much kimchi I have like this much sauerkraut four times a day and I've also added some ginger root I'll take like three of these as well and I'm no longer shedding water okay lots of questions here about not getting water so kimchi and sauerkraut are sources of probiotics like the lactobacillus strains which having shown to help with IBS when it comes to diarrhea specifically one meta-analysis found that the consumption of fermented foods like kimchi like sauerkraut significantly reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea as for ginger we've long used ginger for diarrhea dominant IBS but a 2020 animal study found that Ginger capsules reduced intestinal hypersensitivity of ibsd by inhibiting pro-inflammatory response and like fermented foods Ginger's risk profile is incredibly low so I think both of these tips are really great so congrats Jackson on the better poops 
219,hwEBi4flTRU,[Music] wow we are really scraping the bottom of the barrel for clever weight loss hooks now right no bad angles you're not fat you're toxic people not like reread what they write before they post it because this description starts off talking about how she doesn't have a double chin or fatty arms anymore because she's eating real food and doing some lymphatic drainage program that surprise surprise she sells and in the same breath is critiquing social media posts for promoting getting skinny fast what is this then oh God I'm tired 
220,IwNnaOo3qTc,attempting a 72-hour fast 14 hours in I'm at the gym to hit a leg day before I lose too much energy I was so hungry after that we're about 24 hours in I'm going to bed so early comes in waves and right now I'm real hungry I got so dizzy I collapsed why why why she describes feeling so hungry dizzy collapsing and having blue balls for food when she goes grocery shopping assumingly referring to the obsessive thoughts that she was having about food while not being able to eat yes we know that there are likely benefits to water fasts up to 72 hours so most of the data we do have on said benefits are either in rats or our trans get in short-term but it's very hard to measure the long-term benefits against the risks and cost of doing something like this even if there were a ton of benefits I think that chronicling this miserable Journey without medical supervision insinuating like a no pain no gain attitude in front of potentially millions of vulnerable young eyeballs is irresponsible at best and super super dangerous at worst 
221,ivVCU71OaFk,more nutrition truths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know no food or supplement can boost your immune system if it did we would all have autoimmune disease eating a single piece of bacon is not equivalent to smoking for cancer risk your body doesn't just switch to Fat storing mode after 8 pm all the butter isn't clean and peanut butter isn't junk in fact peanuts actually have more protein per ounce avoiding vegetables because the anti-nutrients is like avoiding water because of hydrogen the way that most humans eat them they're really not a concern fast food versus fed exercise doesn't actually make a significant impact on your weight and just because it has health benefits doesn't mean that more is more I'm looking at you I'm in moms which of these nutrition truths are going to make the most influencers mad 
222,JrsHURW750M,if you're still making your chicken salad with mayo you're doing it wrong tahini chicken salad is the only recipe you need for any barbecues picnics or tailgates this summer I don't actually know what happens at a tailgate but us Canadians love the idea of it so I'm going to show you how to make it all right we start with our tahini we got some lemon juice maple syrup lots of salt some pepper and a little bit of water to thin it out we're going to add in some shredded rotisserie chicken some chopped Granny Smith apple some celery ripe grapes green onions and a handful of sliced almonds give it a toss then you take your retro style Iceberg goblets and filler up that's what she said this is like the sexy love child between your mom's chicken salad and some kind of retro 1970s Waldorf but of course with little upscale Middle Eastern Flair and the best part is you don't have to interact with mayo mayo and me we're not friends oh my God 
223,DvbdySvl538,you should listen to your own excuses to yourself through the lens of how you would hear them if your worst enemy or your least favorite person was giving them to you I am not sure where this is going if my least favorite person told me that she was too tired to go to the gym or oh I don't I don't eat clean that's a lot of work I would immediately lose respect for them because I'm like I'm lazy they're just lazy that's just an excuse this great advice is literally equating yourself with your worst enemy with someone that you truly hate let that sink in for a minute because no amount of exercise no amount of clean eating no improvements to your physical body is going to change that self-loathing but two do you really think that the kind of like tough love approach works because of course there may be outliers for whom this appeals but their research actually tells us that shaming someone into Health behaviors only makes it worse it drives us away from those behaviors so I'm not really sure who gave that amazing advice but I would start looking for a new Mentor stat 
224,m86xW7x7H5c,we're going on a ship fun oh I forgot to pack my seos will you be able to supply will there be gluten-free dairy free options on board gluten makes me bloat and I want to make sure I look the best for the welcome party is there a juicer I'm bringing lots of celeries so we can all start our cleanse together what are the facilities like I normally do boot camp with Johnny three times a week he's so good but I'm sure I could good buy with a yoga mat some ankle weights and a standard set of 3 to 20 lives do you think we can make that work oh I know the lack of gravity makes you we less so if I were to get on the scale will the number just read zero because I need to get a photo of that from my ww Facebook group okay we're [Music] ready 
225,YoSj-2Tw_fw,[Music] I'm sorry is Tick Tock just allowing people to proliferate legitimate Pro a and a content on this app now this piece of content is particularly problematic not only because it's promoting a very stereotypical Behavior but it's equating that behavior with sex appeal privilege and luxury while equating eating I don't know actual food is a snack with an unattractive face filter and financial disadvantage I'm sorry but if creators are not gonna think before they post these things in front of potential millions of vulnerable viewers I'm gonna call them out next 
226,rNv9jmy6Afw,made with real fruit or vegetables this is a super common friend of label claim on kids snacks but also on adults Foods alike let's turn that package around so food ingredients on a label are listed in order by weight so the ingredients that make up the majority of a product are at the top and the ones of minute amounts are down at the bottom we can see that vegetables aren't up here they're down here after flour oil sugar spices seasonings Etc and this is why I often say that a piece of broccoli could fart on a cracker and we could say that it's made with real vegetables now I'm not sharing this to fear Monger I don't think there's anything wrong with veggie straws or veggie chips like they're super delicious but choose them because they're delicious and you like them not just because they contain real vegetables I would we rather see someone choose a plain cracker that they really really like and serve it with real vegetables or another nutritious ingredient 
227,JnxxrQ181MI,help her by asking the social media algorithms to stop reinforcing to others and to her that this is what the world wants of her and Eugenia I don't know you I'm not your dietitian I'm obviously like not your friend I've never met you but I can identify with a lot of the things I've heard you say in the past my voice sounded a lot like yours and it takes an enormous amount of Bravery to choose life and choose recovery and choose to show up for yourself every day and this place like this toxic social media space that we are occupying is not worth your beautiful life so if you see this please contact me I would love to extend an olive branch to help you find the people who can actually help support you rather than just feed you to the proverbial wolves so no strings attached please message me Eugenia even if it's just to catch up and chat 
228,iDE1auEOkUg,and this is not good for vulnerable viewers and it's definitely not good for her you know I lived in a body that was taken over by any and so I know how I interpreted positive reinforcement the likes the followers even the comments expressing obvious concern all of those can be equated with success that the smaller my body the further I push the more love and attention I receive so Eugenia I just want to say that I'm really really sorry I'm sorry that all of us watching around the world and even in your own home like the person behind the camera who's supposed to love and protect you we've all let you down so to anyone watching my video Even if you are eugenia's number one fan help her by reporting her content and I say this with absolute love and concern for her 
229,FCDVp5JLHBg,I've stayed silent on Eugenia Cooney for years now and that's mainly because I have like a general policy that I don't talk about people's bodies I only address the potentially problematic behaviors that they share and promote and Eugenia specifically is a really interesting case because you know even though her body is very likely triggering for a lot of people as evidenced by a lot of her comment sections she doesn't explicitly promote specific problematic behaviors even if to so many people it's implied but you know I thought about this case a lot and again I'm not going to pile onto her as so many on the internet have I am however just really ashamed of us all as a society we have really really let this girl down this video has 64 million views and 2 million likes two million likes there are two million people up regulating the social media algorithms that get this girl more engagement more viewership more fans Etc 
230,W_XBX73Kw64,you're stupid if you're fat oh boy one of those guys this is because it's so easy to lose weight tell me more Troy any type of nuts most people would be surprised that nuts have a lot of fats and calories in them they're not a healthy food that you might think I'm sorry the 90s cold and it wants its fat-free diet plan back nut consumption is actually consistently not linked with weight gain in fact research suggests that those who consumed two or more portions of nuts per week had 31 percent lower risk of weight gain and even in studies when nuts were added to the diet and total calories were not controlled nut consumption still didn't lead to weight gain so this is so old school that it hurts being super fit and slim really just came down to no soda no fried chicken and no nuts sure I guess it really would be super easy but let's chat again when you've done some homework on socioeconomic factors hormones sleep stress scarcity mentality compensatory mechanisms and reward system dysfunctions and honestly be careful who you call stupid because fat phobias not a cute look 
231,i2UzzokPnRA,guys have trigger warnings gone like way too far so I've always used trigger warnings in my content because it just kind of seemed like the progressive and sensitive thing to do to try to respect people's trauma and try to protect them from harm but Recent research actually suggests that trigger warnings may be contributing to that harm so once I found the trigger warnings increase the extent to which people see trauma as Central to their identity which can actually be counter therapeutic because it encourages avoidance and exacerbates fear there's also a whole meta-analysis looking at trigger warning outcomes that found that presenting a trigger warning actually had no effect on the emotional response to those negative materials but in a lot of cases it increased anticipatory anxiety about the incoming content it was also found that the warnings either made people want to read the content more or had no effect at all so folks trigger warnings helpful or harmful weigh in below 
232,xJwGZSWpIoo,today I'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite easy gut healing breakfast starch is one of the things that can really irritate the gut now IBS symptoms are super tricky everyone's experience of what triggers a flare will ultimately be unique but generally speaking we know that starchy foods are hugely beneficial for the gut if we look at resistant starch for example from foods like bananas potatoes oats rice plantains legumes these are all starchy higher carb foods that act as a Prebiotic fiber to prove gut health microbiome diversity short chain fatty acid production and immune response I totally can see why Liz's kind of Keto carnivore style diet has reduced her GI symptoms it's because she's cut out a lot of potentially triggering foods but elimination diets like the controversial gaps diets that she references in the description are not meant to be followed long term you're supposed to eliminate and then reintroduce most of the foods that you cut out in a stepwise manner so as Not to cause long-term harm to the microbiome 
233,NqZFBh0iZpM,let's talk the shocking truth about long-term ozempicues according to an interview with the creator of glp-1 Agnes medications Yen's host because L7 can often suppress food cravings or hedonic hunger people kind of lose pleasure in food and after two years life becomes miserably boring the result you get off the drug and you go back to life as usual the medium time for discontinuation was 13 months with 48 quitting by a year and 70 percent coming off by two years and of course the concern is what is going to happen when people come off these drugs well the data tells us that typically their blood sugars Surge and they gain most of the weight very quickly back so obviously there's a vested interest in trying to find that Goldilocks dose that can suppress hunger and have the intended effects without making you depressingly bored but let me know in the comments below if you guys have any more ozemic questions

237,y4gswC_VXsI,more nutrition truths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know lettuce water won't help you sleep it's literally just water boiled in water a hot girl walk is literally just a walk shot from the neck down you don't have to get protein in immediately after your workout so stop dry scooping your protein as you leave the gym just because you bought it at Whole Foods does make it a whole food vegans of vegetarians can easily meet their nutrient needs so stop writing them about protein the 10 000 step a day rule was actually a marketing tool not an evidence-based suggestion if you've got a bikini and a body congratulations you've got a bikini body eating six meals a day won't boost your metabolism and eating once a day won't make you automatically burn fat which of these nutrition treats are going to make the most influencers mad 
238,aWyld5UmkJQ,carnivores cinnamon rolls do exist carnivore cinnamon rolls I mean even though cinnamon doesn't come from an animal and I'm pretty sure it's against The Unofficial carnivore rules to eat powdered egg whites instead of whole eggs but I feel like this just goes to show how stupid these diet labels truly are these are not carnivore cinnamon rolls this is a low carb low-calorie high protein cinnamon egg white omelette it's only carnivore to this crater because allegedly that's the diet she's now on like to all of you guys this could be weight loss cinnamon rolls or to me this could be like torture cinnamon rolls what's in a name right and I'm here for the creativity and like the stealthy swaps and hacks but if your diet is so strict that you're defining like 40 calories worth of egg whites as dessert it's probably not a healthy diet 
239,B_aD8BDP4rg,I've been doing this job for over a decade I have seen a lot of dangerous sensationalized Wellness claims on this app but what probably upsets me even more is seeing hyper-restrictive content disguised as intuitive eating anti-dieting or Ed recovery tips and this stuff is sneaky as well because these content creators share these beautiful Bountiful meals and snacks and they talk about self-love and they talk about fueling their body with what feels good to it which are all things that we talk about here as well but to me The Telltale sign of a piece of content that is co-opting the intuitive eating movement and dangerously luring in vulnerable Edie populations into a potentially new Ed is the body checks intuitive eating at its core rejects diet mentality but when a video kicks off with Unapologetic body checks or before and after body shots it is very clear that this content is not about intuitive eating or self-care it's about manipulating your body through self-control 
240,4oRlYlYE_RQ,oh Vanessa Bell your first year sleepover Camp you're gonna love it oh now don't forget day one through three you're on your charcoal fast so you don't need to worry about what they're serving in the cafeteria but after that you need to remember the family model if it's not clean and green it's just a dream and don't you even think about it I've taken the liberty of looking at the week's menu and I packed all your favorite Provisions to make sure that your stay is comfortable gluten-free keto bread for french toast day but just one slice because this has to last you the month oh let it spun and carry for hot dog roast you make sure to tell all your bank mates that those cancer sticks are going to age them in five years we already spent too much on Botox over here oh I've got your favorite the chocolate covered almond perfect for when the top spots are making them s'mores oh sugar on sugar on sugar all damn kids are gonna come home with the diabetes okay Vanessa Bell mommy loves you but I'm already late for my lymphatic drainage don't let us down

243,zbgCC9wNDVo,did 95 of diets actually fail so this statistic has been floating around for like decades and for those who have been dieting it's depressing us the good news is that it's actually BS and it was based on a really shitty study from the 50s so if your chances are better than five percent how good are they well different diets will often tell different success rates but most Studies have really poor retention rates and only will follow participants for like 3 to 16 months Max the best site that we have is the eight year long look ahead trial this study found that by the eight year mark half of their 2500 participants kept off at least five percent of their Baseline weight a quarter kept off at least 10 percent and around 10 percent kept off at least 15 percent it's not mind-blowing but it is certainly a lot better than the 95 of diets fail rule but if you want some insight into what increases people's chances of long-term weight loss success leave me a comment below 
244,fGRCd44yESU,let's play more nutrition truths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know putting oat milk in your coffee isn't going to cause diabetes let the people have their damn coffee the way they like it sweet potatoes aren't a superfood and white potatoes aren't junk food nutritionally they're really similar except this one's massive processed foods aren't all bad frozen veg for example are processed and in many cases are healthier than fresh Bagels aren't the equivalent of like six slices of bread you don't have to hollow them out if you don't want to the blood type diet is bloody BS blood type oat can have avocados and blood type A can have berries chlorophyll water won't detox your body or make you lose weight it just tastes gross a core diet doesn't cure IBS you're less bloated because you've just removed a ton of foods which of these nutrition truths are going to make the most people mad let me know below 
245,tDESIn2FGUQ,more unpopular nutrition truth that Wellness influencers don't want you to know it is completely normal for your blood sugars to rise and fall between meals a completely straight line is an unnecessary goal eating soy won't make you grow boobs if it did I would at least fill my eight cup cayenne pepper in your lemon water won't speed up your metabolism it'll just give you the runs a superfood is just a regular food with super solid PR leaky gut is an unofficial diagnosis extrapolated from a real diagnosis designed to sell you detox BS just because you can't pronounce an ingredient doesn't make it toxic not everyone's confident pronouncing coal calciferol if you think you're hungry you probably need some food not 64 ounces of water drinking coffee to suppress your hunger isn't a cool hack it's actually pretty disordered which of these nutrition myths are going to make the most influencers mad now go away because I gotta drink my coffee in peace 
246,3rY6OtpuQks,Abby aren't Bagels equivalent to like six slices of bread um [Music] let's do some stuff has 210 calories 39 grams of carbs 6 grams of fiber and 9 grams of protein pretty good who SES of the same brand of bread has 210 calories 38 grams of carbs 6 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein literally the exact same so if you like your bread round with a hole in it as opposed to square have the damn bagel all right I'll just take the bagel Bagel that's what I thought 
247,BUDHN3ttMkc,when I eat a really big snack that's going to keep me full for a long time this is what I made step one we make a dip and Tick Tock is obsessed with because she's for good reason it's got 14 grams of protein per half cup and it's packed with casein protein which is a slow digesting protein so it keeps you Fuller longer we're gonna puree that until it's smooth all right taking a tip out of my mom's cookbook we got some french onion soup mix here and one of my favorite burger toppings of all time we got some caramelized onions a little extra sweetness in there it's optional but it definitely takes it up a notch protein Rich dip done let's make a snack plate all right gonna finish it off with some everything but the bagel seasoning a little pine nuts and all our paper Dippers got some whole grain crackers and lots of veg you make this and you're not gonna be thinking about food until hours later so if you need more satiating snack or meal ideas I've got a full ebook of my Hunger crush and combos for free to download if you hit up my link in bio 
248,wOQJI7ZIwo8,you've maybe seen the skinny girl shot here on Tick Tock do this one today and you will get snatched please don't do that do not do this once a day or like ever to combine water two teaspoons of cayenne pepper holy two teaspoons of turmeric and a little bit of pepper plus some honey to taste all I have to do is drink maple syrup lemon juice cayenne pepper and water I'm sorry do you want to shoot yourself all day or like dissolve the teeth right out of your mouth because that's the most likely outcome of a drink like this you're shaking are you all right just leave me alone yes it's true the apple cider vinegar has been shown to help reduce response reduce appetite and therefore help to support weight loss but it's also been suggested that one of the ways it helps reduce your appetite is by making you so nauseous that you don't actually want to eat combination of straight up acid and the capsaicin in the Cayenne is literal Napalm for your bowels so sure you'd be losing some weight but it would be because you're like yourself all day I look amazing I'm not really sure what the point of looking snatched is when you can't even leave the house out of fear of having an accident please don't do this please don't 
249,kmb__-QcRl8,when it's in trouble for saying this but sometimes I try to just drink coffee in the morning and like you can start I do my Hunger I do that too but we all do it yeah she just says it um no I'm pretty sure we don't all do that picking up really hungry and then purposefully suppressing that hunger with coffee is not normal or healthy it's legit disordered eating and if you're someone that does that regularly and it works for you cool but as an influential person like why are we not thinking twice about the messages that we share with young impressionable fans online do we want young people to think it's a good idea to just drink a ton of coffee until the hunger pangs go away I would way rather them lie about to the public than to teach young people that we all do it like that to me is really  up but let me know in the comments what you guys think should celebrities be more transparent about some of their more problematic eating behaviors or should they be lying to protect some of their young impressional fans I want to hear what you guys have to say 
250,InpjEPKZGlA,[Music] cancer sticks you know every single hot dog shaves six years off your life and it shrinks your ovaries I thought you're a pro-choice I just do not understand the concept of cooking perfectly good vegetables in carcinogens you might as well start smoking again don't you guys know that they inject burger patties with antibiotics and hormones before they even get to the store the government probably adds in a vaccine there so they can control us don't you know that the best part of the watermelon is the Rind totally sugar-free and keto friendly or Christy do you really need the carbs here Nature's bun [Music] no no corn is just straight up sugary GMO poisons and your body knows it that's why it comes out the other end undigested within an hour Nature's detox [Music] nice seeing you too oh my God I'm gonna need a full cancer Detox After this where are my charcoal pills oh 
251,wPA1IJ3i4kM,people are calling it Nature's ozempic I've got I've gone and over a thousand type 2 diabetes patients found that when compared to Lifestyle modification or a placebo berberine did reduce blood sugar and blood lipids it wasn't necessarily better than oral medications like metformin on its own but when they were combined there was a significant Improvement as for weight loss one larger view of the literature found that berberine moderately but significantly did reduce weight and waist circumference so there's no denying that in the world of supplements berberine is pretty powerful stuff but I still would never liken it to the current All-Star anti-obesity agents like ozempic if an influencer is trying to convince you that you can get the same exact results from an herb as you can from a powerful pharmaceutical it's probably a really big red flag next 
252,XwqE_tT1FKI,a lot of people ask me what I look for in a supplement and to me it comes down to three main things quality transparency and third party testing rituals multivitamin checks all the boxes they're all about delivering exactly what you need in highly bioavailable forms rather than like a hundred ingredients in non-clinical dosages I use their Essentials for women 18 plus but I also use their prenatal and post needle when I was in baby mode but I am super super picky when it comes to supplements and I like that rituals backed by a visible supply chain with rigorous third-party testing for heavy metals microbes and allergens and they share in-depth details on their ingredients and why they're used so if you want to try out ritual yourself you can get 20 off of your first month using my code a sharp 20 or go to ritual.com a sharp20 let me know what you guys think 
253,AQsTHlXVHBQ,we're back with more unpopular nutrition myths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know eating sugar isn't the cause of diabetes it's a little more complicated than that alkaline water doesn't change your body's pH if it did Wellness influencers would die intermittent fasting isn't Magic it largely works because you just skip a meal there's the difference between legitimate bloating and just not having a flat stomach the latter's something that we don't need to fix organic cookies are still cookies how they're grown doesn't necessarily make them a health food drinking coffee on an empty stomach bursting in the morning won't spike your cortisol and make you suddenly gain belly fat gluten-free isn't better if you're not Celiac or intolerant in fact most gluten-free products are less nutritious than their gluten-filled counterparts honey and maple syrup aren't much healthier than table sugar higher in some micronutrients sure but please don't aim to get your antioxidants from sugar which of these nutrition myths are going to rile at the influencers the most 
254,MeIsxC0NGxk,do you want an honest yet unpopular piece of nutrition advice celery juice only detoxes you because it gives you the runs first of all celery juice is like 98 water and water makes you pee and peeing is one of our body's natural detoxing mechanisms so just want to clear that part out there and second if it speeds things up any faster than regular water it's because it's so high in fodmaps that you'll be spending the morning painting the toilet like a Jackson Pollock and she not pretty and I mean like there are less aggressive ways to do your business for most healthy people getting enough fiber water and moving your body is all that is needed to support your body's natural detoxing mechanisms which is ironic because celery juice is devoid of fiber and listen if you like the taste of celery juice great you do you but it's not the magical Elixir that it's being claimed to be next 
255,iB-QUPtK7sY,more on popular nutrition truths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know about eating 3 500 calories less will not make you perfectly lose a pound a week BMI is intermittent fasting isn't Magic it's just a calorie deficit six-pack abs are not healthy for most women celery juice just makes you pee and poop it's not a heavy metal detox you won't get cancer from drinking a diet coke you can't fully replace vegetables with ag1 bone broth won't single-handedly fix your gut what other unpopular nutrition treats did I miss 
256,HJjJKjqrpoY,correct order is vegetables first proteins and fats second and starches and sugars last here are my quick and dirty thought research does suggest that meal component order can have a significant effect on blood sugar though admittedly most of the research like this study has been done on folks with diabetes the study that's often quoted which is likely the basis for Jesse's argument found that doing veggies then protein and carbs or Protein Plus veg then carbs resulted in lower glucose levels than having carbs first and I assume that this is where Jesse got her magic formula this could mean having a salad as a starter and then going on to have your meat and potatoes make sense but what about a mixed meal like a sandwich or a burger or even this beautiful Bountiful salad thankfully we see a huge benefit on blood sugar since satiety by simply combining these Foods Ella my Hunger crush and combo when parsing them out is inconvenient or nonsensical this study found for example that having protein with potatoes or protein before potatoes both had significant improvements in blood glucose and when we look at how similar these lines are on the graph the difference to me does not seem like a big deal certainly not a big enough deal to have your croutons all by themselves or to eat the lettuce off your burger and then have the bun last 
257,k8lCwnoloGA,ah Jenny look at you well your makeup looks beautiful oh my God is that Christy from high school or she really let herself go probably explains the divorce this is my first bite of solid food in three days so rich oh Veronica you're so brave to wear dress this time nice I once ate a bad oyster and I was on the toilet for three days it was great I lost three pounds Kelsey pictures just just hide your body behind mine they only need to see your face it's fine anti-blow pills is there a food option that's vegan gluten-free dairy free keto organic I'm trying to boost right now

292,eJQXR9a2K7o,meal prep with me while we unpack some drama I feel like we need to acknowledge part of like the origin story which is the gross fat shaming that Selena endured when she posted this picture right here first of all Selena looks gorgeous she is a queen but in case people don't realize Selena suffers from an autoimmune disorder so if she does not take her medication she could die it's pretty serious stuff typically the medication prescribed for a lot of different autoimmune disorders are steroids steroids typically cause weight gain sometimes a lot of weight gain all of which is uncontrollable and I see bullying from adult women who a lot of young impressionable viewers truly admire I think how many young girls are gonna die because they refuse to take their medication out of fear of being teased bullied and fat shamed like ladies you have so much power so much influence so much responsibility in this world don't it up 
293,t-B5BvPyIPI,as a dietitian this is the one superfood I cannot live without gotcha superfoods are built let's get that straight there are no foods that have magical powers in isolation and nutrition is more than just the sum of its parts so to me a superfood is a food that makes you feel physically and emotionally super my superfood naturally is coffee it's part of the comforting morning ritual for me it emotionally actually makes me feel great and it has a ton of antioxidants that have legitimate health benefits

295,h9FMGlhgQnk,as a dietitian these are the three healthy foods I refuse to buy right now number one lettuce there's a reason why so many restaurants are dropping salads on their menu right now it is expensive as so while I love my salads I'm probably going to be sticking to stir-fried and roasted veg number two berries I love berries but I live in Canada and we haven't seen a local Berry in like six months so they're either coming from like California or Mexico and they kind of taste like so I'm gonna be sticking to Frozen and try to focus on things like apples and pears and finally kale I just don't like it like unless I'm drowning it in Caesar Dressing the bacon bits and croutons I'm not that jazzed about it sue me you know what I always say healthy food is only healthy if you actually eat it and Hill is more likely to sit in my fridge and wait what healthy foods are you avoiding right now leave me a comment below 
296,23xICsLrU9w,as a dietitian I never buy these anymore and I'm going to tell you why honestly because it's just like the vegan ones better as you guys know I'm not vegan but there are some key vegan products that I just legitimately enjoy more than the G and veggie hot dogs are one of them not only do these taste and smell basically just like a regular hot dog but they actually have eight grams of protein each plus are packed with iron zinc I'll never say no to the OG if someone offers it to me it's like a barbecue but when I have the choice I will always go for the veggie dog

302,erpp6W3zRbs,this is the biggest mistake I see people make when starting a new diet I'm a registered dietitian and I see so many people plan to start a new diet on Monday or on January 1st after New Year's and they spend the entire weekend beforehand binge eating all of the Forbidden foods that they have left in the house you know to get them out of the house before diet starts tomorrow we call this the last supper effect and it's such a common Pitfall in dieting circles that often keeps folks trapped in a vicious binge restrict cycle they were strict too hard they binge they say  it I might as well eat all the things now and start my diet again on Monday rinse and repeat if you're falling into this habit it's good evidence that you're probably restricting too hard try to allow yourself some of these forbidden Foods throughout the week so you don't feel the need to cram everything in before they're completely off the table let me know in the comments below if you've ever experienced the Last Supper effect and how you overcame it 
303,XwevCUqFEc4,I'm a dietitian and I'm going to show you what I order at Nando's I'll get the [Music] chicken okay we got coaching the chicken fat in the sauce and carbs in our bun we've also got lots of fiber in our cauliflower and our salad and let me tell you if you haven't had a Nando's Chicken Sandwich you are missing out

306,q-1_pebYteQ,gluten-free foods have definitely earned a bit of a health halo over the past few years but are they actually healthier for you well like most things in nutrition it kind of depends if your Celiac or gluten intolerant then of course it makes sense to go gluten-free but gluten-free products tend to be more refined and lower in fiber than their gluten-filled counterparts so if you can tolerate gluten I say go with the OG 
307,tesrkPFq3jA,what's a dietitian Sushi order I Love Sushi night let me show you I actually think [Music] s who fats in those fish but let me show you what I ordered the fiber factor I always start with miso soup I think it's really delicious and it's got a little hit of protein in there we've got a sushi sampler here so we've got Protein healthy fats some carbs some more healthy fats and a little bit of veg as well I added in some extra fiber and healthy fats with an avocado salad and I cannot have sushi without edamame it's a great source of protein and fiber honestly it's a colorful beautiful meal and always super satisfying 
308,_O_lN1XbLco,I'm a dietitian and I will never cook with this oil flax okay I know you're probably expecting me to say canola but contrary to what all the other nutritionists on this app will tell you canola actually has a very Miracle omega-3 to omega-6 ratio and it's got a high smoke point so it's great for cooking flax oil on the other hand is often touted in Wellness circles as being super healthy and it is it's loaded with plant-based ala Omega-3s it's got a crazy low smoke point so it's really not appropriate for anything other than dressings dips finishing on meats or vegetables and adding to smoothies my cooking oil of choice is avocado it's got a higher smoke point than olive oil but it's still got the same heart healthy monounsaturated fats plus it's super versatile and delicious for cooking or using Raw

317,UHgWK0WgJQw,Brody do you remember this deep and delicious I do you know I tried one recently it was great when I was a kid but keep your expectations low oh well I got it for five bucks a little bit to make it look a little more Gourmet and also turn it into a hunger crushing cup let's start with a little drizzle of PB I'm gonna add some banana some boobs and some fresh strawberries and I'm going to top it off with some peanuts and I feel like peanuts lost the health Halo Lottery when it comes to the nut world but peanuts actually have the highest amount of protein of all the nuts I mean not according to Courtney's fertility doctor all right so we got protein fiber and healthy fats in our peanuts and our peanut butter plus lots of extra fiber in our berries I feel like this is a huge upgrade Brody what do you think uh there's literally nothing that you think that would make me eat it oh come on snob 
318,ceqgqICdH6I,lettuce is getting pricey no matter where you shop so if you're missing your greens here are five cheaper alternatives to get your fix number one kale it's great for smoothies sauces salads and soups number two brussels sprouts of course they're great roasted or put into other casseroles but they're also delicious shredded and eaten raw as a salad number three broccoli of course it's delicious roasted or stir-fried but the stems are also really delicious If you shred them and put them in a slaw number four cabbage this is a season for slaw and I'm never gonna be mad about it but it's also really delicious braised or stir-fried and finally bok choy it's delicious in a stir fry but it's also really great if you chop it up really fine and throw it in a salad raw see lettuce doesn't need to be the only way to get your greens fixed so leave me a comment below some of your favorite hacks 
319,AtDsakgTkHc,we all remember eating Mr Noodles pretty much every single day breakfast lunch and dinner as college kids did you ever eat them just raw in the world that was like the only way I ate them but today I'm going to show you how to make them into a hunger cushion combo step number one I'm using bone broth for some extra flavor and a lot of extra protein as well noodle them so how come you didn't put the pocket in I just put enough chicken flavor in the bone broth I'm gonna add a little splash of coconut aminos and some sesame oil as well now I've just got some leftover stir-fried veg from last night's dinner and some rotisserie chicken the little hard-boiled egg and some sesame seeds we got protein in the bone broth Chicken and the Egg we've got lots of fiber in the sauteed veg plus we've got some healthy fats in the sesame oil and sesame seeds on top and the Egg I'm pretty excited about this and it literally took me five minutes to make here you go Freddy uh I'm good I think I'm just gonna eat them raw what 
320,0d_Ql6lUXaE,I have nothing against Frozen convenience Foods I love me a quickie meal but 250 calories of just noodles and a few pieces of broccoli is Not Gonna Fill Me Up so I'm going to show you how to turn it into a hunger crushing combo that will step one put it in a bowl so that you feel a little more refined all right adding in some rotisserie chicken I've got some extra steamed veggies that I had cooked off from meal prep gonna add a little nutritional yeast and some extra really good cheese and then we fold in the cheese but how how do you fold it all right we got lots of fiber in our veg some protein in our chicken and our nooch and some fats in the extra cheese still tastes like the early 2000s but it's a step up Poppy 
321,Sm9_1Ecy29c,want to know what a dietitian looks for in a good cookie I'll show you number one not gluten free listen I'm so grateful that we have a wide range of gluten-free products out there for folks who are Celiac or who are gluten intolerant but I'm either of those things and I can enjoy gluten without issues and let's be real most gluten-free cookies are dry as number two over crunchy I mean except if we're talking Oreos because let's be real that's always the exception also double stuffed no question and most importantly a cookie that I actually want to eat listen I'm not eating cookies as health foods if I'm gonna eat a cookie I'm gonna eat the cookie that's really gonna hit the spot oh Mini Eggs yes please 
322,LOErXO3eVWo,Jenny you know you can't eat that it's about gluten oh my goodness Jenny a moment on the lips a Lifetime on the hips why do you even have these oh thank goodness you've got me here heart racing referencing you know Jenny if you can't pronounce it your body cannot process it okay all right just 20 more minutes Jenny and you can get one of those dairy-free sugar-free gluten-free muffins that you love what a treat right Jenny is it really good give you that nothing tastes as good as skinny feels Jedi stop I know you're just concerned about my health and your comments are coming from a place of love but you're making it really hard for me to have a normal healthy relationship with food and my body mom hell is about a lot more than just body weight and this obsession with food and nutrition is going to do a lot more harm than good 
323,C2CRDKIMBFk,this is the one thing I never put in my body as a registered dietitian and I'm going to tell you why honestly I just don't like it we have over 500 studies on aspartame and products like Diet Coke so don't let other influencers on this app convince you that they're poisoned honestly I don't like the aftertaste and I also don't love sweet drinks in general so yeah I'm just gonna stick with my bubbly water and call it a day 
324,ObpUlHau-TY,[Music] living lovely okay folks olive oil is rich in skin supporting nutrients like vitamin E and A Plus healthy monounsaturated fats which some early research suggests may help to improve skin aging but like you can also just cook with it you can also just use it in like a salad dressing you don't have to take a shot of it if that doesn't bring you Joy just saying 
325,tAUGo2_HmmM,Brody are you team jelly or whole Berry my family always have the jelly well that's too bad because my family always did whole Berry and I'm going to show you how you have to show Aunt Janet who the sauce boss really is all right you know the drill so satisfying I love adding chopped Apple to Cranberry sauce even if you're going to make a homemade because cranberries are so tart there's a lot of added sugar here and the Apple helps to stretch out that Sugar by adding lots of natural sweetness not to mention I think it gives it a nice texture plus it adds lots of fiber as well I'm also going to add a little orange zest here to bump up the cranberry flavor just add some apple and fastest way to make a can of cranberries look homemade 
326,NOoRKkgQ7pU,happy what holiday pie does a dietitian pick um um the one you like the most and I like pumpkin or more fat but it's the holidays and if you're intentionally choosing a pie that is healthier for its slight nutritional Edge you're gonna have major food fomo and food fomo AKA fumo I'm gonna call it fumo fumo often results in scarcity mentality which typically just results in a binge we are eating holiday pie every single day so the best holiday pie is the one that brings you the most Joy foreign 
327,YzubzqCPkYU,Abby was a dietitian eat during the day before a holiday dinner to save calories before the big Feast um does fats that I actually enjoy starving yourself in the day leading up to a larger than usual holiday meal is a recipe for a binge when you're feeling emotionally and physically deprived of course you can't help but overeat the more intuitively you can eat leading up to a big holiday meal the more intuitively you can eat during it 
328,sgmvjiZdcOA,have you I always find that I need to eat during the night what's a good balanced snack that I can make before bed let me show you all my favorite hunger crushing combo bedtime snacks we're bedtime snack got our oats we got some hemp hearts some milk whatever you got on hand pinch of salt give it a quick stir and I'm popping this into my microwave for a few minutes I love to add in a little bit of ripe banana and just kind of mash that right in there for some extra carbs a spoonful of almond butter because almonds are a great source of natural melatonin for the body and sour cherries are also known for their sleep promoting benefits and of course you guys know I love a little protein before bed because that is the key to helping you stay Fuller all night long so this is the Cherry Barcia from Bill Barr it's got 17 grams of protein and it also packs the same kind of cherry flavor that we love let some of that chocolate just kind of like melt in and I promise you you will not be hungry at midnight 
329,HTG-MaSUaX0,here are three things a dietitian won't buy at the grocery store unless you want a dutch oven your partner every night these are not my idea of a brownie it may have 50 fewer calories but it is like more than 50 less delicious of fun I'll stick with the Canadian classic it just hits different I don't know about you guys but I eat food for like actual energy and there's no energy in whipped peanut spread listen I'm not demonizing any of these Foods if they bring you Joy then amazing you enjoy them but I'm all about choosing foods that are both sea cheating and satisfying not just about choosing the lowest calorie options possible 
330,I2mjvj0HPJg,everyone on a dietitian or is that chipotle I'll show you so on the bottom there I did half white rice because I prefer white rice to Brown but I don't love a lot of rice and I find that a lot of these burrito bowls tend to be just like basically mainly rice so I want to leave extra room for some beans and some extra veg in there then for my protein I did black beans and chicken for some healthy fats I did the guacamole and they were very generous with the guac and of course double down on the fajita veg and the lettuce so I have lots of fiber in there as well oh and I can't forget the cheese because cheese is life it is awkward trying to eat this in my car but we'll manage hmm 
331,X02nvpL9gpM,Bella Hadid just posted the most insane looking sandwich and I think I need to try it so we're gonna try to get through it as fast as we can olive oil balsamic lays dried oregano pinch of chili flakes dried basil Pepper and a little salt we're gonna mix that up so the next step is the Mayo now she uses fresh minced basil in this but my instacart shopper got me dried she adds some like lemon juice to that with the kind of pickled peppers and she like presses them into the bottom of the bun she adds some red wine vinegar to the lettuce we add the dressing to the lettuce we do some of the aioli lettuce on this side provolone cheese salami shaved turkey breast some Tomatoes Drew us with that on top nice who knew that Bella Hadid was such a sandwich artist Bella I approve 
332,0NskB9pdPcE,so as a dietitian how do you like to make your eggs anyway all the ways but if I had to pick a single way to do eggs this is what I do most often off three Rich eggs my little hack is I add in a little bit of cottage cheese cottage cheese is like packed with protein there's 14 grams of protein and a half cup so it's a great way to just like bulk up the protein even more a little salt a little pepper and we gotta obviously double down on the cheese Factor so that they've got lots of really yummy cheesy flavor Brody are you ketchup are you hot sauce definitely hot sauce but I do love ketchup as well well I got this like Curry ketchup so it's like spicy and it's like a ketchup kind of Base it is next level good so that's what we're using today cannot wait to dive in what do you mean oh yeah 
333,FL_PA8RXlWA,cause you're just a man honestly is any kind of milk sacred these days okay folks let's go over this one quick oats contained carbohydrates bound up with fiber which slows down its blood sugar response and also improves it's satiety profile oat milk will have lower amounts of that fiber so in that sense it's going to create a greater blood sugar response than Whole Food oats but that doesn't mean that it's pure sugar nor is it horrifically bad for you it actually does have small amounts of fiber protein and a ton of other essential nutrients and it's a great option if you have food intolerances or allergies to things like nuts Dairy and soy and it tastes great so for goodness sakes can we stop trying to find fault with every food oh 
334,0SIJlwPjLMk,welcome to Wendy's hi um can I have the Apple pecan salad and a Junior Frosty please the chocolate and the new camera apples the classic chocolate please Perfect anything else that's it I saw how small the frosty was and I was like I need something else so we got some extra chili as well thank you that was so fast all right in the chili and the Little Junior Frosty and the salad here we've got 52 grams of protein and 11 grams of fiber pretty decent I would say and we got some fruit and veggies in here as well do you use a spoon or a straw for your Frosty I'm going with the spoon 
335,fIYwl6TGo6Q,my PMS slash birthday Edition but I mean bikes are healthy today because if I know I'm getting my period soon I really make sure I'm healthy to avoid any period cramps we just want to be cautious about putting too much stock into eating very healthy or in her case actually identifying as a very healthy person which can be a bit of a slippery slope into disordered eating behaviors like orthorexia second can you eat your way out of period cramps we know that Ultra processed foods are typically higher in salt and saturated fats the former of which can increase feelings of water attention while the ladder can increase prostaglandin production which may increase the severity of cramps if you also find yourself constipated thanks to the extra progesterone leading up to ant flow boosting your fiber and water intake can also help to move things along if this helps you get through shark week then by all means 
336,XeUwaDUx6-0,yes can I have a grande soy milk latte um and I'll get the egg white um bites and I'll get an oatmeal I'll get the um the nuts and the brown sugar please and the latte wonderful thank you okay so normally I'm a whole egg kind of girl but the egg white bites at Starbucks they just hit different I don't know what it is the the texture it's just like a little cloud and I also just find that the bacon ones are a little bit like too salty for me I don't eat a ton of the sugar just maybe like a couple teaspoons just to sweeten and adding in some healthy fats with our nuts this little Starbucks meal here 32 grams of protein and five grams of fiber so I feel like it's a pretty good start to the day good crunch 
337,wc8PmDdKGPk,what are you doing I'm deconstructing my sandwich Tick Tock said that I have to eat the vegetables first to meet second and then the bread if I want to manage my blood sugars research suggests that there are significant benefits to eating your carbs less we're largely done in folks with diabetes and the one that was done with healthy participants had eight subjects oh so it's all it's actionable it just totally over complicates things we do know that there are benefits to dressing up naked carbs by pairing them with a source of fiber protein and healthy fats aka the hunger crushing combo and if it makes sense in the context of a specific meal to like have your veggies first like a salad for example then I think that there is some benefit to that but stressing over deconstructing your sandwich or meticulously making sure that you're eating a piece of broccoli or chicken before a piece of pasta in a casserole seems like it's missing the forest from the trees 
338,uRGvL7HczNY,make sure everyone sees the ingredients bad guys there's sunflower oil in this why do I debate of Wellness culture it actually makes me mad folks stop producing Foods down to a single ingredient yes oat milk contains some sunflower oil to improve the mouth feel there's actually a few different types of sunflower oil some of which are higher in monounsaturated fats and others higher in polyunsaturated fats and looking at this label I'm seeing more monounsaturated fats and omega-6s So nutritionally speaking I think this is a pretty nice looking product that I also happen to know tastes really great so just a little Pro tip here folks buy what you like and if an ingredient doesn't work for you no problem choose something else but can we stop with the elitist food shaming it is really not a cute look next 
339,C-pdpyF3lrw,hey everyone i'm abby sharp i'm a registered dietitian and this is what i eat in a day when i'm super tired af coffee is essential i did an iced soy latte i had a greek yogurt parfait with chocolate chips banana and granola plus a kind of gross looking smoothie that's actually really nutrient dense for lunch i had a chicken greek salad and this kogaman which was absolutely out of this world dinner was turkey sausage asparagus and fries then i had cottage cheese parfait and some aussie bites 
340,veh98fUAzdU,this is gonna be a hot take and i know i'm gonna get a lot for it but this is something that i have to call out mayonnaise is gross as i'm kind of weird about my mayonnaise situation where i'm fine with it if it's already on a sandwich if it comes on a burger if it's a fancy aioli from a fancy restaurant i am down but there is no chance in hell you're ever gonna find me reaching into a mayo container scooping out that gloppy sloppy mess with the it makes that sound can't handle it and putting it on my own sandwich i can eat it i can taste it i can smell it but i cannot interact with it leave me a comment below if you agree 
341,WNHTQnrcG5c,i'm a dietitian and this is what i eat in a day coffee always then i mix some protein powder into my cereal with berries plus a slice of sourdough with cream cheese and figs lunch was quesadillas with some salad and guac plus a little greek yogurt parfait went out for dinner and had some pizza and pasta with chicken and finished with a handful of chocolate chips and nuts

369,EPsKHtIQ3aU,how to evaluate a protein bar the source of protein can differ some people's tummies tend to feel better with certain kinds exactly how much protein there is no legal definition for what counts as a protein bar by learning to view nutrition labels neutrally can be helpful to evaluate it for yourself many protein bars also contain fiber helps us feel full and satisfied for longer periods of time eating a protein bar high in fiber could lead to indigestion different types of bars Also may use different fiber sources some people react differently a variety of sweeteners are usually used for some artificial sweeteners can cause tummy upset but they're usually totally fine from a health and a nutrition perspective if you prefer more Whole Food Source bars that's okay but you do not need to fear consuming a protein bar that is more processed it may be helpful to zoom out and peek at the total calories some may be more fit for a lighter snack and some for a more filling one do some experimenting and have some fun with the process

380,Ojy0BXC89dg,only eating junk food is not necessarily a right of passage for your intuitive eating Journey it's not wrong or bad but often times people think that only eating these types of foods is how you become an intuitive eater and eventually it'll all just click not always true there's more to it than that one of my biggest tips is tuning into your hunger and fullness cues before jumping right into breaking all of your food rules and stocking your house otherwise of course we won't know how to stop eating those Foods what happens if you say yeah yeah Colleen that would have been great to know but I already started eating all of the things not to worry we're going to slow down think about the foods that you want to eat but also how different foods make you feel do not feel guilty or wrong or ashamed if you feel like you're in this place of only wanting to eat junk food you're not alone you're definitely not a lost cause

405,gmU3pfjReWE,clutch twinsies I'm making a wrap too did you use the low carb ones so clutch no mine's just a regular old wheat one girl you got to try these they're way less calories yeah they are which is actually why I chose this one my body and most people's bodies need more energy than that specifically from carbs at meal time but have you seen the amount of fiber that's in here that helps keep me full oh for sure they do pack a serious punch and that can be great I just be a bit careful of how many of those you consume it's like half a day in one shot might give you bowels some troubles if you're not used to it my wheat one has less but still a decent feel full Boost and the extra fiber in there won't make up for the lack of calories your body needs enough energy no matter how much fiber is added otherwise it'll still feel hungry maybe add a handful of chips pretzels or crackers on the side heck no that defeats the low carb purpose I'm trying to be healthy the purpose of adding carbs is to be healthy and properly fueled suit yourself I'll see at the candy jar in an hour 
406,0LCXoyHJJQ4,hi hi would you like some Girl Scout cookies I really shouldn't I feel way too guilty oh I'm selling them so you wouldn't be stealing them oh no no that's not what I meant I just started this new diet and I'm trying to be good cookies are so bad for you if they're in the house I just can't stop eating them no junk in this house but good luck out there okay bye hi do you have any of those coconut caramel ones yeah lots those are my favorite too give me two boxes that way I can have some later on in the year when you guys aren't selling them anymore sure miss Felicia said she can't even keep cookies in the house without eating them all are they really bad for you no food is good or bad you know how when you eat too many cookies and your tummy kind of hurts Miss Felicia forgot how to stop before that point thanks to something called keto what do you say the next time you and I both eat cookies we practice eating the amount that makes our bodies feel good deal deal okay put me down for the two boxes and I'll see you later Felicia thinks carbs are scary she hasn't seen anything yet 
407,Pjq7JEHFS5A,check out my giant peanut butter cup holy sh Wait is that a rice cake yeah but you'd like never know so good I don't doubt that's a tasty little or rather big snack you got there but I think I know the difference I'll stick to these look how much more you can eat here it's huge yeah it is but Studies have shown that the volume of food consumed only had a small and short effect on satiety they also show that when we eat larger portion sizes we eat at a faster rate with larger bites which can delay feeling satisfied cuz you're just shoveling it in and not actually savoring it so you're saying we all need to eat teeny tiny little portions no what I'm saying is you need to eat what you find satisfying if you enjoy the crisp crunch of a rice cake go for it but if you want ares's have ares's you'll be much more satisfied what I find satisfying is taking care of my body and being healthy me too and that's a big reason why I don't have food rules it's better not to resist your Cravings avoiding them just makes you fall to pieces

424,b_1BtITs8gY,I'm a non-diet dietitian and I bought light english muffins and here's why whenever I'm picking a carb in the options available I ask myself if having the whole wheat option would be just as satisfying as picking the white refined option in this case the answer was yeah I honestly wouldn't notice a big difference between the two then I saw the option for whole wheat or light multi-grain and I was like wtf's the difference turns out they're pretty close but the light ones had double the fiber which can help keep you full longer keep you regular and benefit things like cholesterol levels they were also the same price which is V important to this Midwest Gale who likes to stick to a budget you can pick the English muffin that makes the most sense for you it might be different from my choice but that's why these ones ended up in my cart Pro tip Greek yogurt little granola for crunch oh yeah delicious

468,9OH_uqxVYhY,one of the best things that I've done for my body image recently is to stock up on new bras actually bralettes from parade bras shouldn't make you think about your body more that just causes us to ruminate and causes poor body image and there's a big difference between something fitting your body and fitting your body comfortably you need something designed with smoothing comfort that literally feels like nothing which is why I love this seamless smooth lift triangle bralette but also because it comes in this cute sherbet pattern but hurry before it sells out cuteness also boosts body image guys do your body image a favor and get new undies and bralets at 40% off during parades Black Friday sale use code rules 40 when you shop the body diverse inclusive fabulous brand that is parade I am obsessed I literally have so many of these obsessed

471,Zh6TeYkiSSw,I haven't eaten all day I've been saving up for this oh do you want a snack whenever I go into a meal overly hungry I end up overeating it's a biological response plus I can't even taste or enjoy the food cuz I'm just inhaling it eating before isn't bad it actually can be really helpful stuffing that's a lot of carbs oh carbs are great they're actually our body's preferred energy source here I'll take them there is so much sugar and cranberry sauce it is so bad for you yeah there can be but that's okay the sweet n with the savory turkey so satisfying I don't even want to know what the scale is going to say tomorrow I won't know what it says I don't weight myself anymore and I just focus on how I feel it's so much less stressful and it's actually more effective for my overall well-being remember your weight is not your worth nor a direct reflection of your health this is so good is it from Costco

473,UnTQnNv9Fb4,I'm a registered dietitian and this is my favorite recipe for a healthy guilt-free pumpkin pie step number one is to grab your keys or find some way to make it to Costco grab a 3 and2 lb plate of goodness for $5.99 this is guilt free because guilt is an ingredient all food and beverages are free from it enjoy your pie however you like it best if that's getting it from the store go for it if you like a less sweet version or maybe you don't like the crust well I don't understand that but that's fine you get to decide what is satisfying to you and what makes you feel your best both mentally and phys physically for me I'll be enjoying this it is actually the best and that is a hill I will die on

506,WziE8fmd9BI,smoothies should only have a half a banana a full one is way too much carbs and sugar I'm only gonna add half a bananas today for my personal preference if I also add the blueberries I want to add snacks should always be a hundred calories or less these little packs are perfect and way healthier than an Oreo I actually enjoy the light crunchy wafer Taste of these and the grab-and-goat pack is perfect but they're definitely not a replacement for when I want a real Oreo skip the carbs and wrap your burger and lettuce I chose a lettuce wrap so I can have more room in my tummy for fries today both would have made me feel overly full and I get so much more enjoyment from fries another day might be different but today this is what feels good and satisfying

581,0rHqeEmi7IM,lunch time same here I'm starving what you got there watermelon duh did you know it's like 92 water so you can eat like so much of it with so few calories my Gale Health babe underscore XOXO says it is like the best summertime volume eating cake I've been having it all week for sure it's delicious but I'm not sure I'd follow that value meeting advice you said you were hungry right like starved today so annoying well if you eat a ton of low calorie high volume foods like watermelon your stomach is gonna be full no doubt but you probably won't be satisfied you can fill your stomach to the brim but if you're not giving your body what it needs like calories carbs fat and protein you're probably just gonna end up in the pantry 20 minutes later elbow deep in the jar in Nutella that happened to you yesterday didn't it shut up call like I see yeah

583,uAqjN-URYS8,didn't you have toast for breakfast yeah one sliced peanut butter banana and one slice with a fried egg and now you're eating a sandwich that is correct very observant of you isn't that kind of like a lot of bread wouldn't you like swap a bell pepper in there somewhere eating bread multiple times a day is totally fine no carbs will make you gain weight firstly that's very fat phobic and secondly carbs are actually what makes our brain function properly they're kind of important whatever you know not eating enough carbs also makes you cranky and Moody just saying 
584,rWpoxYTWjKE,hey fit fam today I'm going to show you everything I eat in a day but first let me give you a good look-see at how ripped I am friendly reminder that when a full day of eating leads with a body check the underlying message is likely if you eat what I'm about to show you you will look like this which is 180 not true if we all ate the same things and did the same exercise as we still wouldn't look the same just like this guy could eat the same things and do the same types of exercise as the big old husky lokai down the street they still wouldn't look alike honor what your body needs not someone else's 
585,Cie_8QyHxHE,we never restrict how much food you're allowed to eat as long as you pick from this list of food that has none of the calories that your body's actually looking for we don't label Foods as good or bad but these Foods get the green light and green means go so have Adam and these foods have a red one and we all know what a red stop light means right we want you to have a healthy relationship with exercise and not see it as a form of punishment but if you want that slice of cake you better get moving to earn some more points to spend on it this is about transforming how you feel and not how you look it's really not about weight loss but here's the before and after of someone who clearly lost a ton of weight with the program to reinforce the idea that smaller is better see it's totally not a diet it's a lifestyle 
586,YapNdkKMvoc,oh hey hot stuff I just love the way that your tummy's got some of that jiggly jiggly and that cellulite on your thighs it's so in right now I mean cottage cheese is having a moment I think you should just walk around naked all day you delicious snack you I don't love my dimply thighs but that doesn't get to ruin my day my body's feeling a little fluffier today but it still deserves to be fueled regardless I wish my body looked like hers but that doesn't mean my body is wrong or needs changing loving my body doesn't mean I need to like it all the time 
587,gLgtR0MQpII,what I ate yesterday does not dictate what I eat today I will fuel my body normally and not cut back I don't need to make up for what I ate by burning it off it's okay to relax if I ate in a way that didn't feel good yesterday I don't need to beat myself up I'll just use it as a learning experience to help me have a more comfortable outcome next time yay for learning I can trust myself around all of the leftovers swearing them off will only make me want them more I'll let my body guide what I eat sometimes that might be more cake and sometimes it might be asking for a vegetable neither are wrong or bad that meal that I'm stressing over is less than one tenth of a percent of all the meals that I'm gonna eat this year that is so not worth stressing over 
588,DlgUyrTJrXI,saying I'm obsessed with these is an understatement let me show you how to make these cookies and cream pudding pops take one vanilla pudding cup add it to a bowl and mix it with a half cup of whipped cream now grab a plastic sandwich bag and add two cookies in there and this is where you can get some aggression out and crush them up add your crushed cookies to the bowl and mix it up I like to add a little bit more crushed cookie to my popsicle mold and then you're going to take your mix and fill them up pop your Popsicle sticks in and just go back and make sure they're all covered see how we didn't add any guilt so great Right freeze until hardens usually about four to six hours save this video to try

594,73VNivdIpfQ,oh man Heather took so much less food she's not a little piggy like me her self-control is probably how she dropped the baby weight so fast this postpartum depression has hit me so hard I can't even enjoy this I just want to feel like my normal self again and Emily hasn't even gotten any food since I've been here girl scout willpower this is my second party today and I treated the first one like a total binge Fest I'm gonna be sick if I have another bite oh hey at least Rachel's going back for seconds I wish I could just listen to my body that confidently without feeling guilty oh man I've barely eaten all day to save my calories for this I feel like an out of control ravenous Beast guess I'm restricting again tomorrow and Shannon is leaving before dessert man what I wouldn't give to not feel as addicted to sugar as I do must be nice I have got to go if I have one bite I won't be able to stop and I don't want anyone to see that that stays in the privacy of my own home I wish I could just eat like a normal person too 
595,l1n4zGy8ttA,foreign have you lost some weight nope you're right you haven't don't worry there's still time before summer what I guess someone's deemed it a cheat day oh Thomas you don't need to cook me one of those processed toxic hot dogs I saw in the morning show that for each bite of hot dog you lose five years of your life why we've got double carbs hot dog bun and macaroni salad what are we carbo loading for a marathon tomorrow do you have any veggies that aren't covered in mayo I personally would have just used plain non-fat Greek yogurt less calories maybe you cannot take that tip for next time Nana was asked to bring dessert I got my famous sugar-free jello with Factory whipped cream the best part is you could eat the whole thing and it would still only be three points oh we were so bad who wants to go get some steps in and burn it off let's go 
596,fjjRAGK0wJ0,it's okay if you prefer to eat whole unprocessed food okay if you if you prefer to buy organic it's okay if you prefer to eat a Snickers date instead of a real one it's okay if you prefer not to eat artificial dyes and colors what's not okay is shaming people for not doing the same 
597,U-UYkl_V6Bk,oh my gosh stop don't even know what cheese is addictive oh is it yeah cheese has an opiate like effect that makes you addicted stop eating the cheese it's true I read a study about it and do you read the part of the study where in order to induce this opiate like effect they had to inject this stuff straight into the brains and bodies of rats that is not a reflection of how we normally eat cheese even if you eat like a lot of cheese fine go ahead and eat it but when you have to go to cheese rehab don't come crying to me and say I didn't warn you well considering that we have zero research to support that having some cheese on your salad a slice of cheddar on your Sammy or enjoying a wine and cheese night with the gal who's gonna have these claimed effects I think I'll be fine but you've gotta ask me if I like cheese what just do it do it do you like cheese why yes my favorite gouda I don't get it man we could not be more different 
598,xypVakDwq5I,okay bread eggs oh eggs like whole eggs they're a super easy way to add a high quality protein to basically anything if you're looking to add some protein just get a carton of egg whites only or better yet a protein powder that way you can keep your eating low fat and low calorie kind of sounds like you're stuck in 1998. welcome to 2023. we embrace the whole egg like the nuggeted goodness that it is eggs provide essential vitamins and minerals for Healthy Living Like choline vitamin B12 iodine that's why I take a Daily Greens powder it's packed with nutrients I mean that is one way to get your body some nutrients but even then the egg still provides a unique nutrient package that just can't be beat like the lutein and zeaxanthin they help protect our eyes from Blue Light eggs are actually really great for us they're not just for making cakes a cake how unhealthy I hope that was a joke are we done with this whole interrogation thing or are you going to tell me 87 reasons why I shouldn't have bread on my list too 
599,A7CMYB7H7XA,it feels so gross I ate like crap this weekend Oh don't beat yourself up it happens I've got to cut back this week no carbs and I don't even want to see a dessert maybe not the best idea what if this week instead of focusing on taking things away you focus on adding in things that would help make you feel good studies show that restriction actually makes us feel more out of control I guess that's an idea and what if you looked back on this weekend non-judgmentally and just reflected taking note of what felt good and what didn't and just making note of anything that you might want to change for next time rather than just repeating the cycle that's another idea this approach is actually much more sustainable and it's going to give you a better result long term doesn't it just feel better to give yourself some self-compassion versus being your own personal bully okay I can try that I'll add in my green juice this week and then I'll make note of any other post weekend cleanses I might want to try next time oh not quite

601,6R8ULeFu4Nw,all right does anyone want any more food before I put it away how are tummies feeling look at how colorful this fruit salad is that can signal that we're giving our body a wide variety of nutrients so that they can feel their best and allow us to run and play no foods are good or bad some foods might be more Soul nourishing and that's okay okay sweetie you said you want some pretzels as a snack sure thing what if we try dipping them in some peanut butter to see if they help us feel full and satisfied longer you know what I'm still kind of hungry and that's okay I'm gonna go get some more food 
602,hEruAgRUCLk,time for breakfast what y'all making I'm embracing the life of no food rolls this is the sixth day in a row I had this so glad you're ready to give up dieting and you have full permission to eat this but I gotta ask are you enjoying this does it feel good sure it feels good to break the rules oh no doubt but eating intuitively with no food rolls isn't just about always picking the sugary food available it's about fueling your body in a way that feels good both mentally and physically well I haven't pooped in four days in my mid-morning sugar crashes pretty bad I think you might have a skewed kind of extremist view of the idea of intuitive eating you're in the place that I like to call not dieting where you're rebelling against diet culture but you're not yet fully eating intuitively intuitive eating should feel good so it's okay if I go make myself a smoothie instead of eating this I think I'm gonna be sick if I take another bite now that's an intuitive choice we're getting somewhere 
603,2PT78iXtods,Rachel looks so thin in that dress I wish I looked like that I hate my curves I hate that my body looks like an eight-year-old boys why can't it look like Sarah's look at her butt In Those Jeans mine would look like a pancake I wish I wasn't so bottom heavy this top would look so much better if I had Julia's perky boobs oh my land on my back is killing me from these huge knockers it's like a workout carrying them around if only I was as fit and toned as Lauren I hate how masculine and Meaty my body is what I wouldn't give for Emily's feminine curves

619,Kyu2HW4GQkY,do you need to lose weight or do you need to learn how to not bingy do you need to lose weight or do you need to focus on choosing foods that make your body feel good do you need to lose weight or do you need to focus on finding forms of movement that you actually enjoy if you need to lose weight or do you need to find ways to cope with life feeling chaotic and out of control do you need to lose weight or do you need to focus on repairing the damage that our society's unrealistic beauty standards caused focusing on weight loss might seem like the right answer but it usually acts as a Band-Aid and prevents us from getting to the actual root of the issue at hand

694,DvpPj7kHetw,shouldn't you be using cauliflower rice for that to avoid the carbs actually adding carbs to the meal is partly why I want to add it it's actually a little bit of gentle nutrition our bodies need carbs to functionally and feel their best I doubt that's true and even if it is couldn't you be using like brown rice or quinoa or something anything that's not a whole grain is basically just like eating spoonfuls of sugar it is true no matter how much keto babe 827 posts otherwise and personally I don't find brown rice or quinoa nearly as satisfying there are other sources of whole grains that I'm okay with like bread so no worries there I'm just gonna stick to the white rice that is is so dumb you know I've got a fix for your irritability it's called eating carbs and Foods you actually like plus you'll probably be a lot less gassy because that cauliflower takes trouble and everyone can attest to that

697,H3Kjnr5D_7I,eight meals bigger than your head okay let's talk the goal is to still fill up your stomach but to eat less calories overall and the stretch receptors that we have in our stomach are one way that our bodies signal to us that we're full and satisfied that we've had enough food but our bodies are smarter than that they'll realize oh so that was just a bunch of volume not actually the energy and the fuel that I needed not only is focusing on volume eating likely not to leave you feeling full for very long it's likely that when your hunger comes back it's gonna come back stronger I mean having a meal that's larger than like the size of a pea can be satisfying let's be real but when you leave out the actual energy that your body's needing like calories carbs and fat that volume eating is likely just gonna backfire be wary of focusing on only valuating you don't always need to stuff your tummy to the brim to be satisfied [Music]

815,YMsFqWbo5l4,why the heck are you not adding this to your dishes to get really easy nutrients hi I'm Sarah I'm a registered dietitian and I'm going to tell you what to add and when to your dishes so you can add really easy nutrition today we're talking about a really requested ingredient chia seeds now you can add chia seeds to a lot of dishes but today I'm going to add them into my oatmeal you can add it to smoothies yogurt or even baked goods to enhance that nutrient profile chia seeds are super high in fiber antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids I will say you may want to pace yourself if you have tummy issues because that fiber can really be hard on the gut sometimes in about two and a half tablespoons you get about five grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber I will say it doesn't really have a flavor but it definitely does have a texture Pro tip after you're done eating the chia seeds make sure it's not stuck in between your teeth I may have learned that the hard way chia seeds come from a Chia plant and even though they're small tiny seeds they definitely have a ton of nutrients in them it's a super simple way to add nutrients into your foods you can usually find them somewhere in the baking aisle cheers
