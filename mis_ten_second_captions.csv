b2ZfFeMUfgk,all right guys here's a couple of more sort of unusual side effects from a carnival bite that many people mentioned so the first one is that many people notice that they tend to sunburn less
zBSfAQaNFhY,okay here's a couple weird side effects from the carnivore diet that some people have reported I've seen some of them myself so number one is the lack of
wyALe27tc04,a little interesting fact so over the last 20 30 years calorie consumption in the United States has not really gone up appreciably but the Obesity rates certainly have our microbiome actually
9A0dO_KRo3E,okay after doing the last video on the macronutrients there's a lot of people asking what are you doing to get those macronutrient erasers so you know currently like I said about 300 grams of protein and around 200 grams of fat
pRNTmVO3ygQ,all right let's talk a little bit about uh the macronutrients I'm consuming while I'm leaning out so normally at sort of Maintenance I'm usually sitting you know roughly 300 grams of protein
8HvEXbTvdx0,hey folks as I am currently been leaning up some people ask me kind of what I'm eating what my macronutrient breakdown looks like so just for review got up to around close to 270 uh on Carnivore I'm
nxoFpFKAbYM,we'll get another common misconception around a carnivore diet is you will become constipated now what is true is most likely if you regret dramatically reduced your fiber intake you go to the
uLEFrKA7oCo,okay here's another mistake I see people on a carnivore diet often doing and this is a very common mistake and one is people do this for the reason of losing weight which is you know Common because there's a lot of people that are
ZdgFUH-o4AI,okay here's one mistake that I see people on a carnivore diet doing quite quite commonly one is is trying to quit coughing when you first transition to a carnivore diet now certainly reducing or
6sNH0kTlwhQ,okay so the question on the other side of the scale but what about protein what's protein you need well you know I mean I think the US RDA is 0.8 grams per kilogram that's abysmally low no one should be that low that's that's that's
iIk4qkYmZ6g,okay if you watch the last video the obvious questions well who are the groups that might benefit from an even higher fat diet well certainly uh what I've seen is people healing certain
jvMw4aoiK1E,okay people are asking to ask me you know about macronutrient Racers on a carnivore diet well I mean for most people you're going to consume probably between 60 and 80 of your calories
9kaoG78e9M4,all right a follow-up question on the dog feeding video and there's one of them there's Maximus and there's Sasha anyway Sasha's about 45 pounds Max was about 18 pounds

VUpFewydSwg,so if we have people that are metabolically healthy is defined by the last video are they likely to have heart disease when their apob levels or LDL levels are
6wJv9qigcMA,okay further discussion on LDL or for that matter APO B now for most people a rise in LDL cholesterol or high level of apob is associated with cardiovascular
BOFHJY89xV4,uh what if I go on a low carb ketogenic or carnivore diet and my LDL cholesterol goes up well first of all first thing I'll tell you is you should not ignore that just because you're on a low carb

n7IDgTx3ym4,okay a lot of people consult me with regards to trying to get really lean on a carnivore diet and one of the concepts that I have utilized the so-called concept of fat cycling that is where you
lWF60znL3fk,a lot of people ask me about how much do I need to eat on a carnivore diet well I think if you're starting out the first thing you need to do most people you know have some sort of bad eating habits the first thing is eat enough so you
GQskSm1OpXU,so I am a Bitcoin hodler just just for for reference and the guys that got me you know same thing who wrote a Bitcoin standard and a guy named Mike Goldstein and they are both carnivores and they've been doing it for longer than I I think

Y-CwTfiDnVs,account you should think about as a metabolic disease you know it has a component of metabolic syndrome and often has a component of immunological compromise and so whether or not you eat
G0AHYsKvvoE,all right some people ask me what's it after a car or not and ketogenic diet and which one might I want to choose well there are some similarities both are very low carbohydrate both often have a lot of meat in the diet but you
ycvoDkaKc9s,okay does the carnivore diet help prevent cancer well the the answer to that is we have no idea there's no way to really know that but what I can tell you is that a carnivore diet often helps people lose weight uh so they remove
