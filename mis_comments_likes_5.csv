Some of it will be broken down by gut bacteria. And any that remains will play a useful role in binding excess amounts of minerals.

147,_VMXFURJmEk,"['So 7 days into this Keto and IF change, I\'d like to share what has happened. Long story short, I was at 256lbs as of 9 days ago. I\'m a homebrewer and avid craft beer fanatic, or as my wife calls me, a funtional alcholic! I woke up last friday and said to myself ""I\'m done with this drinking!"" I\'m not sure how but your video channel popped up on my Youtube home page...fate I guess. Needless to say I was hooked after watching many of the videos and as of Friday afternoon I ordered some of your goods and started the process of Keto. First 2 days were rough, I felt awful and was very bored. I usually spend my day\'s off ""sampling"" 16oz pints of new beers..plural. In addition, watching football without beer just seemed pointless. But stuck with the plan.\n\nI work Sun-Mon-Tue-Wed, 12hr shifts. In addition, due to the nature of my work, IF was already a part of the daily life, so a plus! Fast forward to Tuesday, a wooping 5 days into this program, it was noticed by my wife first but others at work. ""Are you loosing weight?"" Why yes, yes I am!  Now for this morning, day 7. I went on my walk. I usually had tried to walk on my days off at least once or twice for 5 miles. But today was different. I started out with coffee, coconut oil and some half-half. Then before the walk made a mixture of your wheat grass, electrolytes, nutritional yeast and olive oil. I walked 7.5miles today! Let me explain why that\'s a big deal. \n\nIt\'s not that I hadn\'t done it before. I ran the 2011 Austin half marathon and the 2012 full marathon. But injury after injury along with life circumstances lead me down this darker path. I have 3 torn tendons (unrepairable) in my right foot, an unrepaired blown ACL in my right knee, and an unrepairable torn disc in my back. When walking, after about 4 miles, I\'d get very stiff and my right foot was in excruciating pain so 5 miles was the most I could handle. This morning? After 7.5 miles, I stopped. Why? Only because I wanted to get on with the day and could feel myself a little depleated. Truly, noticed my right foot was NOT in it\'s usual pain, it\'s just normal! My back was not in pain neither, nor was I stiff walking like an old man at the end! THIS IS AWESOME! My assumption is because my inflammation is much much less. Maybe Dr. Berg, you can verify this assumption?\n\nAfter arriving home, I began making a concoction from one of your videos. Some Organic Kale, spinach, a carrot, some cucumber, ginger, more yeast, wheat grass, electrolytes, coconut/avocado oil with a bit of stevia. While it was blending, I weighed myself. The scale came in at 241lbs. A full 15lbs loss in a week!?! WOW! I\'ve noticed the stomach is tighter and not drooping over the beltline as before. I\'m noticing any craving for sweets, and especially beer, is all but gone UNTIL I get a little depleted like this morning. The mind begins to play tricks when one gets depleted! I was thinking about brewing while still on the trail. HA! I\'m still struggling with falling and staying asleep but doing your suggestions and I\'m sure as time moves on this will improve. But even with the sleep issues, I\'m still more awake and more energetic then before. If this is the success after just 7days, what will life be like in 7 months?\n\nI\'d like to Thank you Dr. Berg for all the hard work you put into your video series in helping out your fellow man. It\'s truly been a gift in my life. You get right to the point, add just enough detail to not overwhelm the mind and give simple easy to follow steps for making our lives better. Looking forward to the continuation of my new life. Nothing but warm hearted Best Wishes for you!

Then I tried the Mediterranean scam grain diet for 6 months (didn’t know the report on the “Mediterranean” diet had been falsified)- but it made things much worse and even put me into peri menopause and many other issues like cysts that got to be quarter size round, so painful! Fibrocystic masses too were big! I was fed up and decided to go dig and dig to see if anything would reverse this! Found Dr. Baker, Dr. Berry, and Dr. Chaffee with carnivore diet! Then found out cruciferous veggies can ruin your thyroid and prevent natural absorption of iodine found in foods!  I had eaten lean skinless chicken breast (a half of one maybe once a day), rices, and broccoli for 6 years- age 40-46 and daily! I want ladies to know they need to avoid cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, Brussel sprouts, asparagus, and cauliflower to prevent fibrocystic breasts- but plants in general cause it! Your body needs iodine for your lady organs and all other organs, but especially your thyroid! They really mess up the thyroid which messes up your hormones and causes all other issues! One big domino affect! I ask people to go watch Dr. Chaffee with Dr. Sally Norton on plant toxins! Fibrocystic breast issues are now what doctors have settled as “normal!” I truly feel it is considered an auto immune issue / plant toxic illness of inflammation that can be reversed with carnivore! If you look the rates of fibrocystic illnesses is drastically increasing- including breast cancer- and it’s posted on line that nobody knows what causes those! They tell people not to eat saturated fats!  I eat fatty meats of beef and eggs- and 8 months on carnivore no more cysts and i have only one smaller fibrocystic mass left that is super small- continues to shrink- not the large mass it once was- shrinking drastically on carnivore diet! \n\nCarnivore diet cured so much for me! \n\n* No more perimenopause- completely reversed! \n\n*Period cycles all timed perfect with 4 week intervals.And no PMS symptoms, but only the actual menstrual cycle itself! \n\n*No more night sweats\n\n*No more waking every 2 hours at night!\n\n*It used to take me 20 minutes or longer to fall asleep at night when I would first go to bed at night- before carnivore. Now it takes like a minute or less. Haven’t noticed since I am out fast! \n\n*No more life long eczema \n\n*No more cold hands\n\n*No more cold body temp in general! Used to feel like a reptile - only warm in texas sun.\n\n*No more IBS symptoms (gas, bloating, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea) \n\n*No more feeling low energy by 12pm and zombie by 4pm\n\n*No more purple looking hands in winter\n\n*No more brain fog\n\n*No more arthritis that I felt in hands, knees, and hips- or elbows\n\n*Lost 45+ pounds from former baby weight and peri menopause weight. \n\n*Always had 20/20 vision with slight stigmatism- but in March doctor said my stigmatism is reversing! \n\n*Don’t sunburn as easily anymore and tan well.\n\n*Wrinkles around eyes seem to be much less. I am 46 and look like I am in early 30’s.\n\n*Gums look super healthy. Dentist seems irritated as my teeth are not dirty when cleaning every six months. Think they know they won’t make money off me.\n\n*No more sore chest from monthly periods- no swelling feeling of fullness or discomfort that prevented me from sleeping on my stomach. Now I sleep every night on my stomach! \n\n*Fibrocystic Breast issues reversing! Almost all gone after 6 years of buildup!\n\n*no cravings unless they are for meat\n\n*no more angina symptoms before a period- which started about 3 years ago.\n\n*No more feeling weak like almost passing out and dizzy around ovulation and periods\n\n* no more fingers swelling- that started a few years ago- rings kept being tight- is pattern I noticed. One ring I had resized larger and it’s super loose now. Will have to resize smaller. \n\n*feel stronger- now lifting barbells not just hands weights. Dr. Baker said since I am 46, and 5’7” at 122lbs- need more resistance training to add more muscle weight. . So bought a 47lb barbell off Amazon and have 40 extra pounds added to it. Will continue to progress with that.\n\n* i had started growing grey hairs in one of my eyebrows, few hairs at a time, but no grey in my blonde hair yet - but assumed it was coming before Carnivore. Now on carnivore I have had no new grey hairs growing in eye brows and still no grey hair in my natural blonde hair. And in the sun it gets super light highlights.\n\n* no more body odor! \n\n* I used to get a little anxiety with large crowds- like if attending special events- but since on carnivore I don’t get it that much.  \n\n*I was a bit OCD before carnivore, but so much more relaxed so barely like that.  \n\n* I was a relaxed person before, but somehow am even more relaxed and never stress about things. \n\n*Since I was a young child my sense of smell has been terrible. But 8 months on carnivore my sense of smell has gone crazy!  I smell things even far away! Amazing!\n\nUpdate as of June 16th- I am now 9 months zero carb carnivore eating mainly 73/27 ground beef and ribeyes, eggs at times, and all things listed above still gone. I can add my knees don’t pop anymore when I walk. So arthritis had been gone for some time, but now no popping! They would make a click pop noise before when I would get up in the mornings- but it’s gone. Awesome!\n\nIf I think of anything else will add. ☺️👍🏻\n\nI know when people go on carnivore they are trying to heal something, but if they aren’t like me and notice small things- they may not notice they are healing way more than they realized-  things plant foods were causing! And they need to remember, processed foods are made from plants- but so are whole foods (raw or cooked!) they are all toxic!\n\nThe carnivore diet cures! ☺️👌🏻 The body is a network made of multiple gears- and if one gets messed up it causes a whole domino affect of problems like I had! The carnivore lifestyle is not a fad, it’s the ancestral human way of eating! Go Carnivore for a few months and see how you feel! ☺️👍🏻\n\nOne more bit- I don’t feel colon cancer is silent! Here is my theory- stage one is IBS symptoms (gas, bloating, stomach cramps, constipation, diarrhea.)  Stage 2 (If you didn’t listen to your body in stage one)- diverticulitis, Diverticulosis, ulcers, polyps, celiac, leaky gut, and so on. Stage 3- colon cancer! There ya go!

It is also packed with vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B11 (folic acid), vitamin A and E. A. C and E are the strongest antioxidants among vitamins. Broccoli also contains a broad spectrum of minerals. Manganese, potassium, molybdenum, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, selenium, zinc and iron are contained in large quantities in the green brother of the cauliflower. It also contains the amino acid tryptophan. After eating broccoli, the body is able to remove toxins. This is mainly due to the presence of natural vitamins A, C and E, which are strong antioxidants. These help stop oxidation processes and prevent inflammation. Detox, oxidation and inflammation at the cellular level are linked to the development of cancer. The toxin-removing properties of vitamins are enhanced by phytonutrients with antioxidant properties. Kaempferol, quercetin, carotenoid lutein, zeaxanthin and beta-carotene are key substances when it comes to the antioxidant effect in the body. These substances enhance the detox effect of the A, C and E vitamins present.

Also, I would be interested to see the blood work of people who regularly consume oats as part of a predominantly healthy or carnivore based diet. In theory, phytic acid can chelate minerals, but by how much?? Would be interesting to see real-life examples. The same goes for vegetables and leafy greens rich in so-called oxalates and defence chemicals. Perhaps there are useful compounds and combinations we don't yet understand. I think it's reasonable to enjoy garbage food on occasion rather than eat them every day, and for the most part, eat good quality meats fruits and vegetables if they work for you. There are hormetic benefits to most stimuli in life, whether that comes from foods or the environment. For example, saunas and ice baths feel horrible, but the post biological adaptation is beneficial. Weight training is uncomfortable too, and inflammatory, but the post biological response and adaptation is, once again, positive. I think you can identify negative and positive ingredients/constituents in almost all things. Just focus on balance, enjoyment, moderation, and most of all quality. I believe biological/physiological dysfunction is the result of genetics and lifestyle combined, and will be very different for everyone. Resistance training and other good lifestyle choices will buffer the damage to an extent. But, If we constantly damage our bodies through regular consumption of processed low quality sugars and fats, then our cells and organs lose function, it's at that point that oxalates and lectins etc in foods affect us most. If we exercise and eat good quality foods for the most part, I believe our body is more than capable of buffering the effects of intermittent poor choices. I always enjoy what Paul has to say, and I believe he has contributed some very useful information to the public. I am just grateful for how easy it is to access useful information these days. There is more than enough info out there for us to all design our own enjoyable way of eating, tailored to our individual needs. Do what works for you 😊, if you like oats and your mineral levels are fine, then go for it. If your levels are low and you regularly consume oats, then trial going without to see if that brings your mineral levels back up.

Same with the mild and corn salsas and guac, everything was chopped, combined and seasoned in house from fresh vegetables.\n\nThat’s all gone for the most past, since the e-coli scare they ship in the meats pre-marinated and pre-cooked. They just get a bit of color from the flat top, the grill is more performative than anything… The mild salsa is still mixed in house but the tomatoes come from a heat treated vacuum sealed bag now instead of them being fresh tomato’s that were cut in the back. \n\n\nMy chipotle fans know exactly what I’m talking about, when the steak randomly completely changed. That’s the most noticeable difference, honestly the chicken isnt as effected but it was also better before it was coming in pre-cooked, but the steak? With chipotle changing the steak to coming in pre-cooked, chipotle steak died at that point. \n\nWhat was once legitimate pieces of marinated steak just as if you marinated and cooked a steak at home, turned into that nasty pre-cooked beef chunk stuff you find in microwave dinners overnight… When chipotle was actually making the steaks there we were able to serve medium rare/medium etc plus, since the meat has to stay hot in the steam bar, if you put the steak chunks in when they’re medium rare, in 15 minutes the heat keeping the meat warm is enough to bring that medium rare to a medium, ~30 minutes in and it was fully cooked but not overcooked to sh*t. It was perfect because if customers wanted it nice and medium rare, they just had to ask for a fresh batch and if they wanted well done, we’d just give them the steak that was closest to the bottom of the pan where it gets the warmest so that stuff went from medium-rare to full cooked the fastest. Now it’s all over cooked and as dry as can be, it doesn’t even compare to the original chipotle steak. Nothing hit harder than getting a freshly cut slice of chipotle steak right off the grill.

1053,yqLuGtlPUQ8,"[""I love Paul and regard him as one of the best heterodox thinkers out there in nutrition, but I'm still struggling to wrap my head around the fruit/fructose thing. Especially when he gets onto fruit JUICE as if it's interchangeable with whole fruit. High quality white rice is also a great source of carbohydrates that's very low in plant toxins, and it's 100% glucose so it doesn't have any of the metabolic downsides of fructose. Fruits have more micronutrients, sure, but they're far from free of plant toxins. Some are full of oxalates, some are full of lectins, and some are full of defense chemicals aimed at dissuading certain species from eating them so that the plant can have its seeds moved around by the animals of its own preference. Setting aside the liver metabolism of fructose, it's a dose-dependent AMPK blocker which halts fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria, and it increases uric acid load which further signals to the body on multiple levels to down-regulate energy expenditure and pack on fat mass. In evolutionary terms, outside of a tropical setting, the availability of large amounts of ripe fruit was rare and seasonal, and was something humans would gorge themselves on during a brief window of availability providing a huge bolus of fructose that needed to be stored for survival through the coming cold season — so, not surprisingly, we have a bunch of different biological signaling pathways built up specifically around fructose that increase appetite, reduce resting energy expenditure and will to motion, and upregulate fat deposition. If a tribe of nomadic hunter gatherers stumbled upon a small grove of wild trees bearing ripe fruit, they would have pitched camp there and gorged themselves on all the fruit they could manage to eat for days or until all the fruit was gone, the rare signal of sweet, ripe, juicy fruit in a world otherwise devoid of sweet tastes driving their appetite to maximally exploit that source of calories which far exceeded their daily caloric needs and store it in their adipose tissue for later. We now have year-round access to a huge variety of ripe fruit that's larger, even more palatable, and ~5-10x sweeter and higher in fructose. It seems silly to me to think that we can just eat unlimited fruit 365d/yr (or even concentrate it into fiberless juices) and expect that those evolved signaling pathways around fructose just won't have any relevance or negative metabolic trade-offs."", 'Thats why you COOK the vegetables to bring out the nutrients and get rid of the defense mechanisms', ""I find Paul's carnivore diet approach much more relaxed and adds variety.Love it"", 'I eat carnivore, plus berries and fruits.

Seed oils. Omega-6 Linoleic acid. \n\nJust like humans, chickens and pigs accumulate linoleic acid when they are fed foods high in this fatty acid.

I\'m actually a PhD student in BioAnth currently and I can assure you that humans are not carnivores. Your digestive system is not suited for that. We are omnivores. Our ancestors did not have abundant meat and ate mostly plants. Meat was a luxury and would never be wasted. So eating meat is absolutely good for you and is what helped our ancestors develop. When we began making tools we got more meat and fat which led to bigger brains and better tools and so on. Most of your diet should be from plants. Root, stem, leaf, and flowering vegitables. Fruits are another important part of plants, but overall vegitables should be your main plant source. Our ancestors have always eaten every parts of plants. Our relatives today eat plants. Thats what apes do. We eat both plants and animals. Even in our recent history, modern sapiens still ate a majority plant based diet. We can see tooth wear patters that support this due to constant chewing on rough plant matter. Even my ancestors who were viking ate majority plants. They consumed a lot of protein in the fall and winter for more energy and warmth, but day to day in warmer months was plants that were more abundant and some fish here and there. Winter was all about eating your food stores. Grains, dried plants, and slaughtering your animals. \n\nIt scares me that people like this can become doctors and get a following. Can a human survive on a carnivore diet? Sure, but it is hard, takes lots of money and work, and you have to be genetically able to maintain it. Only fractions of populations can maintain such a ridiculous thing. Don\'t buy into the things these people sell.

They also do not learn over generations. Those are concepts we made up to explain evolution. If there is more seed dispersed -> more plants, and that's how specific adaptations are formed. At some point there was some random coating around a seed, that was slightly more nutritious than others-> some (already plant eating) ape ate them and dispersed more of it.
