    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will familiarize ourselves with the YouTube API. By completing this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "* Collect summary information for one or more YouTube channels\n",
    "* Gather data on the channel's uploaded videos\n",
    "* Gather samples of comments from each video\n",
    "* Navigate and use code documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Some code/Python skills used in this lab include: dictionaries, JSON, while loops, try/except, and pandas Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This lab is _HEAVILY_ based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56_Cx36oGY). A lot of the code comes directly from it, but it works perfectly well for our purposes. Feel free to watch it yourself for a more guided walkthrough of the process (especially setting up your API key).\n",
