## Background

The TruthTube project seeks to address the common issue of false information about health on YouTube, with particular focus on the influence of Short-form videos on nutrition-related topics. The project aims to identify how viewers engage with and perceive nutritional health content through the analysis of comments from both misinformative and informative sources.

## Research Questions

 RQ1: How does the sentiment interaction between the content of a nutritional health video impact its popularity and uptake of content by viewers when it is informative versus misinformative?

 RQ2: Are people who consume health-related content on YouTube more likely to be recommended evangelical/conservative content as well?

## Our Data Science Process
1. **Define Problem:** Our research questions were reformulated to center on the impact of sentiment interaction on viewer engagement and popularity in nutritional health videos. Additionally, we investigated the possible relationship between the interactions with health-related material and the recommendation of conservative or evangelical content.
2. **Collect Data:** We ensured an extensive data set with high-engagement videos, user comments, and information from many sources by collecting a scoped-in range of YouTube videos covering health themes from both informative and misinformative channels.
3. **Process Data:** The gathered data was cleaned and preprocessed, with unnecessary details eliminated, outliers addressed, and data types standardized. To identify possible misinformation, we performed textual content preprocessing, tokenization, stop word removal, and split text into tokens.
4. **Visualize Data:** A matplotlib-generated histogram clearly illustrates the sentiment distribution of the comments. Sentiment trends and outliers can be easily identified due to this visualization, offering a clear overview of the sentiment patterns found in the comment data.
5. **Analyze Data:** A more thorough grasp of the general sentiment surrounding the health-related YouTube video is made possible by the computed sentiment scores. Progress in our studies reveal patterns in sentiment, audience engagement, and possible relationships between sentiment and other metrics.
6. **Report:** Together with other important insights that are backed up by proof from the data analysis procedure, the sentiment analysis results can be presented. To effectively explain the analysis's findings and contribute to a thorough comprehension of the research topics raised, our report makes use of computed visualizations, summary statistics, and actionable insights.
