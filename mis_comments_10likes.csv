Some of it will be broken down by gut bacteria. And any that remains will play a useful role in binding excess amounts of minerals.

147,_VMXFURJmEk,"['So 7 days into this Keto and IF change, I\'d like to share what has happened. Long story short, I was at 256lbs as of 9 days ago. I\'m a homebrewer and avid craft beer fanatic, or as my wife calls me, a funtional alcholic! I woke up last friday and said to myself ""I\'m done with this drinking!"" I\'m not sure how but your video channel popped up on my Youtube home page...fate I guess. Needless to say I was hooked after watching many of the videos and as of Friday afternoon I ordered some of your goods and started the process of Keto. First 2 days were rough, I felt awful and was very bored. I usually spend my day\'s off ""sampling"" 16oz pints of new beers..plural. In addition, watching football without beer just seemed pointless. But stuck with the plan.\n\nI work Sun-Mon-Tue-Wed, 12hr shifts. In addition, due to the nature of my work, IF was already a part of the daily life, so a plus! Fast forward to Tuesday, a wooping 5 days into this program, it was noticed by my wife first but others at work. ""Are you loosing weight?"" Why yes, yes I am!  Now for this morning, day 7. I went on my walk. I usually had tried to walk on my days off at least once or twice for 5 miles. But today was different. I started out with coffee, coconut oil and some half-half. Then before the walk made a mixture of your wheat grass, electrolytes, nutritional yeast and olive oil. I walked 7.5miles today! Let me explain why that\'s a big deal. \n\nIt\'s not that I hadn\'t done it before. I ran the 2011 Austin half marathon and the 2012 full marathon. But injury after injury along with life circumstances lead me down this darker path. I have 3 torn tendons (unrepairable) in my right foot, an unrepaired blown ACL in my right knee, and an unrepairable torn disc in my back. When walking, after about 4 miles, I\'d get very stiff and my right foot was in excruciating pain so 5 miles was the most I could handle. This morning? After 7.5 miles, I stopped. Why? Only because I wanted to get on with the day and could feel myself a little depleated. Truly, noticed my right foot was NOT in it\'s usual pain, it\'s just normal! My back was not in pain neither, nor was I stiff walking like an old man at the end! THIS IS AWESOME! My assumption is because my inflammation is much much less. Maybe Dr. Berg, you can verify this assumption?\n\nAfter arriving home, I began making a concoction from one of your videos. Some Organic Kale, spinach, a carrot, some cucumber, ginger, more yeast, wheat grass, electrolytes, coconut/avocado oil with a bit of stevia. While it was blending, I weighed myself. The scale came in at 241lbs. A full 15lbs loss in a week!?! WOW! I\'ve noticed the stomach is tighter and not drooping over the beltline as before. I\'m noticing any craving for sweets, and especially beer, is all but gone UNTIL I get a little depleted like this morning. The mind begins to play tricks when one gets depleted! I was thinking about brewing while still on the trail. HA! I\'m still struggling with falling and staying asleep but doing your suggestions and I\'m sure as time moves on this will improve. But even with the sleep issues, I\'m still more awake and more energetic then before. If this is the success after just 7days, what will life be like in 7 months?\n\nI\'d like to Thank you Dr. Berg for all the hard work you put into your video series in helping out your fellow man. It\'s truly been a gift in my life. You get right to the point, add just enough detail to not overwhelm the mind and give simple easy to follow steps for making our lives better.

Zero carb carnivore here!- here is my story on why I removed vegtables!  \n\nSo everyone knows- I am 46, turn 47 soon- but look like I am in my early 30’s. I am now 122lbs and 5’7”. I have done a zero carb carnivore diet for 8 months now. Before I was saved by the carnivore diet I was 165lbs (weight would continue to creep up since I was 40 years old.)  And I  had so many other issues that are now cured. One was I had fibrocystic issues before carnivore. It built up over a six year period of Western / SAD diet. Doctors said it was normal, nothing we can do. “Part of aging and now normal.” Nope! Then I tried the Mediterranean scam grain diet for 6 months (didn’t know the report on the “Mediterranean” diet had been falsified)- but it made things much worse and even put me into peri menopause and many other issues like cysts that got to be quarter size round, so painful! Fibrocystic masses too were big! I was fed up and decided to go dig and dig to see if anything would reverse this! Found Dr. Baker, Dr. Berry, and Dr. Chaffee with carnivore diet! Then found out cruciferous veggies can ruin your thyroid and prevent natural absorption of iodine found in foods!  I had eaten lean skinless chicken breast (a half of one maybe once a day), rices, and broccoli for 6 years- age 40-46 and daily! I want ladies to know they need to avoid cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, Brussel sprouts, asparagus, and cauliflower to prevent fibrocystic breasts- but plants in general cause it! Your body needs iodine for your lady organs and all other organs, but especially your thyroid! They really mess up the thyroid which messes up your hormones and causes all other issues! One big domino affect! I ask people to go watch Dr. Chaffee with Dr. Sally Norton on plant toxins! Fibrocystic breast issues are now what doctors have settled as “normal!” I truly feel it is considered an auto immune issue / plant toxic illness of inflammation that can be reversed with carnivore! If you look the rates of fibrocystic illnesses is drastically increasing- including breast cancer- and it’s posted on line that nobody knows what causes those! They tell people not to eat saturated fats!  I eat fatty meats of beef and eggs- and 8 months on carnivore no more cysts and i have only one smaller fibrocystic mass left that is super small- continues to shrink- not the large mass it once was- shrinking drastically on carnivore diet! \n\nCarnivore diet cured so much for me! \n\n* No more perimenopause- completely reversed! \n\n*Period cycles all timed perfect with 4 week intervals.And no PMS symptoms, but only the actual menstrual cycle itself! \n\n*No more night sweats\n\n*No more waking every 2 hours at night!\n\n*It used to take me 20 minutes or longer to fall asleep at night when I would first go to bed at night- before carnivore. Now it takes like a minute or less. Haven’t noticed since I am out fast! \n\n*No more life long eczema \n\n*No more cold hands\n\n*No more cold body temp in general! Used to feel like a reptile - only warm in texas sun.\n\n*No more IBS symptoms (gas, bloating, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea) \n\n*No more feeling low energy by 12pm and zombie by 4pm\n\n*No more purple looking hands in winter\n\n*No more brain fog\n\n*No more arthritis that I felt in hands, knees, and hips- or elbows\n\n*Lost 45+ pounds from former baby weight and peri menopause weight. \n\n*Always had 20/20 vision with slight stigmatism- but in March doctor said my stigmatism is reversing! \n\n*Don’t sunburn as easily anymore and tan well.\n\n*Wrinkles around eyes seem to be much less. I am 46 and look like I am in early 30’s.\n\n*Gums look super healthy. Dentist seems irritated as my teeth are not dirty when cleaning every six months. Think they know they won’t make money off me.\n\n*No more sore chest from monthly periods- no swelling feeling of fullness or discomfort that prevented me from sleeping on my stomach. Now I sleep every night on my stomach! \n\n*Fibrocystic Breast issues reversing! Almost all gone after 6 years of buildup!\n\n*no cravings unless they are for meat\n\n*no more angina symptoms before a period- which started about 3 years ago.\n\n*No more feeling weak like almost passing out and dizzy around ovulation and periods\n\n* no more fingers swelling- that started a few years ago- rings kept being tight- is pattern I noticed. One ring I had resized larger and it’s super loose now. Will have to resize smaller. \n\n*feel stronger- now lifting barbells not just hands weights. Dr. Baker said since I am 46, and 5’7” at 122lbs- need more resistance training to add more muscle weight. . So bought a 47lb barbell off Amazon and have 40 extra pounds added to it. Will continue to progress with that.\n\n* i had started growing grey hairs in one of my eyebrows, few hairs at a time, but no grey in my blonde hair yet - but assumed it was coming before Carnivore. Now on carnivore I have had no new grey hairs growing in eye brows and still no grey hair in my natural blonde hair. And in the sun it gets super light highlights.\n\n* no more body odor! \n\n* I used to get a little anxiety with large crowds- like if attending special events- but since on carnivore I don’t get it that much.  \n\n*I was a bit OCD before carnivore, but so much more relaxed so barely like that.  \n\n* I was a relaxed person before, but somehow am even more relaxed and never stress about things. \n\n*Since I was a young child my sense of smell has been terrible. But 8 months on carnivore my sense of smell has gone crazy!  I smell things even far away! Amazing!\n\nUpdate as of June 16th- I am now 9 months zero carb carnivore eating mainly 73/27 ground beef and ribeyes, eggs at times, and all things listed above still gone. I can add my knees don’t pop anymore when I walk. So arthritis had been gone for some time, but now no popping! They would make a click pop noise before when I would get up in the mornings- but it’s gone. Awesome!\n\nIf I think of anything else will add. ☺️👍🏻\n\nI know when people go on carnivore they are trying to heal something, but if they aren’t like me and notice small things- they may not notice they are healing way more than they realized-  things plant foods were causing! And they need to remember, processed foods are made from plants- but so are whole foods (raw or cooked!) they are all toxic!\n\nThe carnivore diet cures! ☺️👌🏻 The body is a network made of multiple gears- and if one gets messed up it causes a whole domino affect of problems like I had! The carnivore lifestyle is not a fad, it’s the ancestral human way of eating! Go Carnivore for a few months and see how you feel! ☺️👍🏻\n\nOne more bit- I don’t feel colon cancer is silent! Here is my theory- stage one is IBS symptoms (gas, bloating, stomach cramps, constipation, diarrhea.)  Stage 2 (If you didn’t listen to your body in stage one)- diverticulitis, Diverticulosis, ulcers, polyps, celiac, leaky gut, and so on. Stage 3- colon cancer! There ya go! Not silent at all!\n\nGreat video Dr. Baker! ☺️', 'i eat some sourkraut and some very well cooked vegetables, stops me from getting chronic constipation on full carnivore  , i also a eat some chocolate and treat food now and then, there is   no need to be a total diet nazi and i look and feel amazing .....dont forget good sleep and exercise as  well.

Also, I would be interested to see the blood work of people who regularly consume oats as part of a predominantly healthy or carnivore based diet. In theory, phytic acid can chelate minerals, but by how much?? Would be interesting to see real-life examples. The same goes for vegetables and leafy greens rich in so-called oxalates and defence chemicals. Perhaps there are useful compounds and combinations we don't yet understand. I think it's reasonable to enjoy garbage food on occasion rather than eat them every day, and for the most part, eat good quality meats fruits and vegetables if they work for you. There are hormetic benefits to most stimuli in life, whether that comes from foods or the environment. For example, saunas and ice baths feel horrible, but the post biological adaptation is beneficial. Weight training is uncomfortable too, and inflammatory, but the post biological response and adaptation is, once again, positive. I think you can identify negative and positive ingredients/constituents in almost all things. Just focus on balance, enjoyment, moderation, and most of all quality. I believe biological/physiological dysfunction is the result of genetics and lifestyle combined, and will be very different for everyone. Resistance training and other good lifestyle choices will buffer the damage to an extent. But, If we constantly damage our bodies through regular consumption of processed low quality sugars and fats, then our cells and organs lose function, it's at that point that oxalates and lectins etc in foods affect us most. If we exercise and eat good quality foods for the most part, I believe our body is more than capable of buffering the effects of intermittent poor choices. I always enjoy what Paul has to say, and I believe he has contributed some very useful information to the public. I am just grateful for how easy it is to access useful information these days. There is more than enough info out there for us to all design our own enjoyable way of eating, tailored to our individual needs. Do what works for you 😊, if you like oats and your mineral levels are fine, then go for it. If your levels are low and you regularly consume oats, then trial going without to see if that brings your mineral levels back up.

Same with the mild and corn salsas and guac, everything was chopped, combined and seasoned in house from fresh vegetables.\n\nThat’s all gone for the most past, since the e-coli scare they ship in the meats pre-marinated and pre-cooked. They just get a bit of color from the flat top, the grill is more performative than anything… The mild salsa is still mixed in house but the tomatoes come from a heat treated vacuum sealed bag now instead of them being fresh tomato’s that were cut in the back. \n\n\nMy chipotle fans know exactly what I’m talking about, when the steak randomly completely changed. That’s the most noticeable difference, honestly the chicken isnt as effected but it was also better before it was coming in pre-cooked, but the steak? With chipotle changing the steak to coming in pre-cooked, chipotle steak died at that point. \n\nWhat was once legitimate pieces of marinated steak just as if you marinated and cooked a steak at home, turned into that nasty pre-cooked beef chunk stuff you find in microwave dinners overnight… When chipotle was actually making the steaks there we were able to serve medium rare/medium etc plus, since the meat has to stay hot in the steam bar, if you put the steak chunks in when they’re medium rare, in 15 minutes the heat keeping the meat warm is enough to bring that medium rare to a medium, ~30 minutes in and it was fully cooked but not overcooked to sh*t. It was perfect because if customers wanted it nice and medium rare, they just had to ask for a fresh batch and if they wanted well done, we’d just give them the steak that was closest to the bottom of the pan where it gets the warmest so that stuff went from medium-rare to full cooked the fastest. Now it’s all over cooked and as dry as can be, it doesn’t even compare to the original chipotle steak. Nothing hit harder than getting a freshly cut slice of chipotle steak right off the grill.

Things like tallow, ghee, and butter which are all <3% linoleic acid vs seed oils which range from 25%-65% linoleic acid…\n\nThis is also a reason I prefer low linoleic acid animal fats to oils like olive/avocado which contain 15-20% linoleic acid, 7x what is found in animal fats!\n\nHere’s the take away: the best way to detox from seed oils is to NOT eat them, and to favor animal fats like tallow and butter in your diet. \n\nFocus on these in the context of an #animalbased diet of organs (either fresh or desiccated like @heartandsoilsupplements), meat, fruit, honey and raw dairy and thrive. \n#theremembering']",18
