When I moved to the mainland, I was told to avoid spam due to its high sodium and saturated fat content.  Though I understood the importance of limiting this for health reasons, this wasn’t realistic advice for someone whose favorites foods (e.g. spam musubi, fried rice) included spam.  As always, I found the idea of “adding” instead of “subtracting” much more helpful (and culturally sensitive)!  Instead of completely avoiding spam, I may add more nutrients to my meal to make it higher in fiber, nutrients, and protein. \n\nThis is one of many examples of how AANHPI individuals have diverse cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and practices that significantly influence their health and healthcare decisions. By having AANHPI representation among healthcare professionals (including dietitians), we can better bridge the cultural gap and provide appropriate nutrition and diet advice that respects and aligns with the unique needs and preferences of these communities. This includes understanding dietary preferences and cultural nuances that may affect our eating habits and, therefore, our health!\n\nObviously, I’m not advocating for people to eat spam every day, but this would be one example of how much more helpful it can be to focus on what to add to, not what to subtract from, your meals.']",54

You are wonderful!', 'You remind me so much of one of my best friends who is also a dietitian 🥰\nShe’s absolutely incredible and has a passion for helping others with their eating habits so much so that she works at a hospital in DC creating meals for sick patients! When I found out I was pregnant (and high risk) she put together an entire eating plan for me to help me gain weight. She would introduce meals simple and easy like this since I always felt so sick and didn’t want to cook EVER 😅. But the one thing she never did was shame me for not cooking. There would be days where I didn’t want to eat anything but cereal and she would say something along the lines of “well even the super sugary cereal has folic acid in it making it have really good qualities for you and baby”. She never once made me feel guilty for my food choices and only offered suggestions if I asked, which really helped me trust her. \nBut the biggest thing she helped me with was when my older son decided he wasn’t going to eat meat anymore. He would eat eggs but he also hated peanut butter and was super picky about beans if eaten as it is. So this incredible human being wrote an entire book of vegan/vegetarian recipes for me that were super quick and easy, but also tasted amazing! Some of those recipes have made it into our dinner routine as a family even though he’s the only non meat eater in the house. If it wasn’t for her this would have been a major struggle for me seeing as I was extremely ignorant of what non meat meals looked like. It’s been years since she’s did all this for me but every now and then she still calls me to tell me about new recipes or other options for my kids (and myself with my medical issues). \n\nI said all that because you remind me of her.

I’m trying to incorporate more balanced meals into my diet and when I saw spinach in oatmeal, I had to at least give it a try. I’ve never had oyster sauce before and sesame oil is something that I like depending on what I eat it with. I made my own chili oil at home because it’s not available where I live, which probably affected the taste. I was very skeptical, staring at the plate for a good few minutes before I finally decided to try it, and here are my personal thoughts. The taste is great, it’s well balanced and it doesn’t feel like it would be heavy on the stomach. For me, because I’m so used to sweet oats as a part of my childhood when my great grandma and grandma would make it for me, I think it might be a texture thing on my part. If I replaced the oats with something like rice or brown rice, maybe even quinoa, I think I would’ve liked it more.

Though people claim that consuming nuts on a flight can trigger an anaphylactic allergic reaction, there is no evidence that peanut vapors can cause such a reaction.  Though it's not completely necessary given the cleaning process between flights, it's recommended that those with severe allergies wipe down their tray table and seat before use since severe reactions are more likely due to contaminated surfaces.  If I ever bring nuts on board, I always check with my seatmates before consuming and wipe down the seat, seatbelt, table, and screen after use to minimize cross contamination.  \n\nObviously, if someone alerts the attendants and they make an announcement to not eat nuts on the plane, I won't eat nuts on the plane lol this is only for the 99% of the other flights when no announcement is made!\n\nIf people are curious about sources, here’s the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology website with a list of studies and sources: https://www.aaaai.org/allergist-resources/ask-the-expert/answers/old-ask-the-experts/peanut-air-travel#:~:text=The%20bottom%20line%20is%20that,itself%20circulates%20and%20causes%20reactions."", 'Brick Lane is a great area to walk around!

Make sure to keep noodles and base separated so noodles stay dry.\n- If eating immediately, add boiling or hot water to the glass and close. Let sit for ~5-10 min.\n- Shake your jar (you can use a towel since the glass will be hot) or turn your jar upside down to let the base mix with the water\n- Store prepped jars in fridge up to ~4 days. Be sure to bring Mason jars to room temp before pouring in hot water in to prevent them from breaking due to thermal shock\n\nNotes:\n- To reduce the sodium, opt for the reduced sodium versions of Better Than Bouillon and soy sauce. Like most broths, this broth is higher in sodium so I wouldn’t recommend drinking the entire jar of soup if you need to limit sodium (I usually like to eat everything, but leave the leftover broth)\n- You can sub coconut aminos for soy sauce if you need to limit sodium']",18

I had a full blown binge eating disorder, and it was really bad. To be honest, food is a double edged sword. It can be so beautiful and can power a person to do incredible things.

The OCD made it so anything which touched the counter was bad in my mind and I began to obsessively clean. This didn't help my ED because I wouldn't eat at all due to fear of preparing food on the counter no matter how many years passed.

It is a MANUFACTURED/NON-NATURALLY OCCURING form of glutamic acid called D-glutamic acid different from the naturally occuring L-glutamic acid that is found in almost every living thing including us humans, and of course the famous tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu, etc. After all, MSG was originally derived from kombu/seaweed that underwent many different manufacturing steps and chemical reactions before turning into what we know as MSG. Glutamic acids are absolutely essential for functioning, and the L-glutamic acid is bound to proteins and is absorbed slowly when we consume tomatoes and meats and mushrooms. D-glutamic acid is very similar but is free/unbound, so when we eat foods with MSG its absorbed very quickly and glutamate levels shoot up so yes, people can absolutely be sensitive to high levels of glutamates and have symptoms. Like sugar and salt, a moderate amount is just fine (and found ""naturally"" in foods as well), but too much can cause mild toxicity effects in some people - kinda like a ""sugar high"" or a ""dehydration/salt headache"". MSG also just has a lot of sodium in general which we all know can cause headaches, high BP, etc. (Obviously there are scientific nuances to the MSG debate that I didn\'t explain in length, so no need to go full keyboard warrior on me, I am aware :)\n\nTLDR: MSG is a food seasoning that is NOT naturally occuring, what IS natural and everywhere are glutamic acids.

Aloo Gobi (potatoes and cauliflower) is a popular vegan Indian dish (also popular in Pakistan and Nepal) that is full of flavor and nutrients!   Its main ingredients consist of potatoes, cauliflower, onions, and a variety of spices.   Not only is cauliflower a cruciferous vegetable, but it’s always a great source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and potassium.  Though potatoes can have a bad reputation in the dieting world, they’re a nutritious food high in fiber and potassium.  To add protein to this meal, you could include a dish with dahl (lentils, peas, chickpeas) or paneer on the side!  \n\nImportant note: Highly recommend enjoying with naan, roti, or rice!

Add 1 finely chopped onion and stir fry until transparent.\n5. Add 2 medium potatoes (1 heaped cup cubed) and stir fry for 2-3 min.  Cover and cook until half done.  If potatoes dry out, sprinkle water and cook.\n6. When potatoes are half cooked, add 2 cups cauliflower florets and stir fry for 3 min.  Then add 3/4 tsp red chili powder, 1 tsp garam masala, 3/4 tsp coriander powder, and 1/4 tsp turmeric.\n7. Mix well and cook covered until both potatoes and cauliflower are almost tender.\n8. sprinkle with salt and mix.  Cover and cook again until potatoes are soft and fully cooked. Cauliflower should be slightly crunchy.\n9. Add 1 chopped tomato.  Stir fry on medium high heat until tomato blends well with aloo gobi masala. This should take 2-3 min\n10.

You do increase your risk of salmonella if you’re in the US and eat unpasteurized raw eggs. \n\nThough I may not be the first dietitian you’ve seen on IG, I’m likely the first Asian (and Hawaii born) dietitian you’ve seen and that’s because there aren’t many of us.  As a result, many people (and dietitians) aren’t familiar with many of our cultural foods which result in many of our foods being deemed as “unhealthy” or “gross”.\n\nIn honor of AAPI month, I’ll be doing a small series of Asian and Pacific Islander cultural foods throughout the month to increase awareness of these foods and how they can fit into a balanced diet.\n\nFirst, we’re making tamago kake gohan (TKG) or “egg with rice”, which is a classic Japanese breakfast food.  It’s one of the quickest and easiest foods to prepare and is so savory due to the seasonings used.  You’ll get protein from the eggs and carbohydrates from the rice if you have the dish by itself, but I recommend adding nattō (fermented soybeans) to increase protein and fiber content!  \n\nMost importantly, there are a lot of misconceptions around MSG and the biggest one is that it’s horrible for us and that Chinese restaurant syndrome is legitimate even though decades of research have disproven this.  A lot of these misconceptions are not rooted in science, but rather racism.  \n\nIn the 1960s, a doctor reported numbness and palpitations after eating Chinese food and playfully dubbed it “Chinese-Restaurant syndrome”.  This caught on very quickly, very likely due to the anti-Chinese sentiments in the United States in the 1960s.  MSG, an ingredient often used in Chinese (and Asian) cooking was initially blamed which prompted many researchers to study MSG.  However, no negative effects were found.  The only study that did find something negative was when they injected rats with extremely high doses of MSG (we’re talking 500x the amount that the average human consumes).  If you inject any rat  with 500x the amount of anything that a human consumes, it will likely have negative side effects regardless of what you inject it with.  \n\nMSG is derived from glutamic acid which is an amino acid that naturally occurs in many foods such as tomatoes, cheese, and mushrooms.  The glutamate in MSG is chemically indistinguishable from glutamate present in these foods, and our bodies metabolize both sources in the same way.\n\nLastly, MSG actually has less sodium than salt despite providing SO much more flavor.  Unlike MSG, excessive amounts of salt has been shown to have negative health effects but yet we still eat large amounts of sodium from other types of cuisines.  \n\nLike ANY food (vegetables, fruit, meat, nuts) people can have reactions to MSG, but the idea that MSG gives most people significantly more negative side effects or “Chinese restaurant syndrome” is false.', 'The way some of yall be panicking so hard at this but happily eat sunny side up eggs and carbonara without batting an eye is INSANE TO ME', ""To people who don't want to eat the eggs raw - if you mix a raw egg into the rice right out of the rice cooker it will get fully cooked really quickly from the heat of the rice, then you can add a poached egg or overeasy or whatever on top :)"", 'OH MY GOD THAT SONG IS SUCH A THROWBACK!
