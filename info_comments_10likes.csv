Though people claim that consuming nuts on a flight can trigger an anaphylactic allergic reaction, there is no evidence that peanut vapors can cause such a reaction.  Though it's not completely necessary given the cleaning process between flights, it's recommended that those with severe allergies wipe down their tray table and seat before use since severe reactions are more likely due to contaminated surfaces.  If I ever bring nuts on board, I always check with my seatmates before consuming and wipe down the seat, seatbelt, table, and screen after use to minimize cross contamination.  \n\nObviously, if someone alerts the attendants and they make an announcement to not eat nuts on the plane, I won't eat nuts on the plane lol this is only for the 99% of the other flights when no announcement is made!\n\nIf people are curious about sources, here‚Äôs the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology website with a list of studies and sources: https://www.aaaai.org/allergist-resources/ask-the-expert/answers/old-ask-the-experts/peanut-air-travel#:~:text=The%20bottom%20line%20is%20that,itself%20circulates%20and%20causes%20reactions."", 'Brick Lane is a great area to walk around!

In fact, many studies have now shown that canola oil is cardioprotective.\n\nThe most common criticism of omega-6 fats  (common sources include canola oil, sunflower oil, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds) is that the body can convert linolenic acid into arachidonic acid, which is a building block for molecules that can promote inflammation.  However, the body also converts arachidonic acid into molecules that calm inflammation and fight blood clots.  What‚Äôs even MORE important to note is that the body converts very little linolenic acid into arachidonic acid, even when linolenic acid (found in omega-6 fats) is abundant in the diet and that eating more omega-6 fats didn‚Äôt increase inflammation (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21663641/).  In fact, eating more omega-6 fats have been shown to either reduce markers of inflammation or have no effect on markers.

It is a MANUFACTURED/NON-NATURALLY OCCURING form of glutamic acid called D-glutamic acid different from the naturally occuring L-glutamic acid that is found in almost every living thing including us humans, and of course the famous tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu, etc. After all, MSG was originally derived from kombu/seaweed that underwent many different manufacturing steps and chemical reactions before turning into what we know as MSG. Glutamic acids are absolutely essential for functioning, and the L-glutamic acid is bound to proteins and is absorbed slowly when we consume tomatoes and meats and mushrooms. D-glutamic acid is very similar but is free/unbound, so when we eat foods with MSG its absorbed very quickly and glutamate levels shoot up so yes, people can absolutely be sensitive to high levels of glutamates and have symptoms. Like sugar and salt, a moderate amount is just fine (and found ""naturally"" in foods as well), but too much can cause mild toxicity effects in some people - kinda like a ""sugar high"" or a ""dehydration/salt headache"". MSG also just has a lot of sodium in general which we all know can cause headaches, high BP, etc. (Obviously there are scientific nuances to the MSG debate that I didn\'t explain in length, so no need to go full keyboard warrior on me, I am aware :)\n\nTLDR: MSG is a food seasoning that is NOT naturally occuring, what IS natural and everywhere are glutamic acids.

You do increase your risk of salmonella if you‚Äôre in the US and eat unpasteurized raw eggs. \n\nThough I may not be the first dietitian you‚Äôve seen on IG, I‚Äôm likely the first Asian (and Hawaii born) dietitian you‚Äôve seen and that‚Äôs because there aren‚Äôt many of us.  As a result, many people (and dietitians) aren‚Äôt familiar with many of our cultural foods which result in many of our foods being deemed as ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù or ‚Äúgross‚Äù.\n\nIn honor of AAPI month, I‚Äôll be doing a small series of Asian and Pacific Islander cultural foods throughout the month to increase awareness of these foods and how they can fit into a balanced diet.\n\nFirst, we‚Äôre making tamago kake gohan (TKG) or ‚Äúegg with rice‚Äù, which is a classic Japanese breakfast food.  It‚Äôs one of the quickest and easiest foods to prepare and is so savory due to the seasonings used.  You‚Äôll get protein from the eggs and carbohydrates from the rice if you have the dish by itself, but I recommend adding natt≈ç (fermented soybeans) to increase protein and fiber content!  \n\nMost importantly, there are a lot of misconceptions around MSG and the biggest one is that it‚Äôs horrible for us and that Chinese restaurant syndrome is legitimate even though decades of research have disproven this.  A lot of these misconceptions are not rooted in science, but rather racism.  \n\nIn the 1960s, a doctor reported numbness and palpitations after eating Chinese food and playfully dubbed it ‚ÄúChinese-Restaurant syndrome‚Äù.  This caught on very quickly, very likely due to the anti-Chinese sentiments in the United States in the 1960s.  MSG, an ingredient often used in Chinese (and Asian) cooking was initially blamed which prompted many researchers to study MSG.  However, no negative effects were found.  The only study that did find something negative was when they injected rats with extremely high doses of MSG (we‚Äôre talking 500x the amount that the average human consumes).  If you inject any rat  with 500x the amount of anything that a human consumes, it will likely have negative side effects regardless of what you inject it with.  \n\nMSG is derived from glutamic acid which is an amino acid that naturally occurs in many foods such as tomatoes, cheese, and mushrooms.  The glutamate in MSG is chemically indistinguishable from glutamate present in these foods, and our bodies metabolize both sources in the same way.\n\nLastly, MSG actually has less sodium than salt despite providing SO much more flavor.  Unlike MSG, excessive amounts of salt has been shown to have negative health effects but yet we still eat large amounts of sodium from other types of cuisines.  \n\nLike ANY food (vegetables, fruit, meat, nuts) people can have reactions to MSG, but the idea that MSG gives most people significantly more negative side effects or ‚ÄúChinese restaurant syndrome‚Äù is false.', 'The way some of yall be panicking so hard at this but happily eat sunny side up eggs and carbonara without batting an eye is INSANE TO ME', ""To people who don't want to eat the eggs raw - if you mix a raw egg into the rice right out of the rice cooker it will get fully cooked really quickly from the heat of the rice, then you can add a poached egg or overeasy or whatever on top :)"", 'OH MY GOD THAT SONG IS SUCH A THROWBACK!
