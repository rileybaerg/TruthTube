11,now think about what breathing problems involve right the diaphragm so you here you have this gallbladder /b duct issue congestion whatever you want to call it that backs up that that breathing apparatus and that can affect your breathing big timeon and this usually can be easily corrected by changing your diet to the healthy version of the ketogenic diet within a minute fasting but as an immediate remedy you want to take something called tdka it's a type of Bol that is very unique because it helps to increase the flow of bile sludge through the bile duck so you would take two of these in the morning on an empty stomach and then 2 in the afternoon on an empty stomach and within a few days you'll just feel a lot better

15,there's this carb that is way more dangerous than sugar okay now people tend to think sugar is the worst thing but there's other things that are even worse than sugar and this specific carb is bad and I'm going to tell you why we take a look at the glycemic index where is Sugar well table sugar is about 65 not terribly High where's glucose 100 where is this carbohydrate between 116 and 136 on the glycemic index so in other words it's a carb that's not classified as a sugar but acts like a sugar in a much more deadly way as far as what it can do to your blood sugars it just will really spike it and this carb is called maltodextrin it's in other forms too it's in modified food starch it's in modified corn starch I mean and it's in many foods they put in a lot of sugar-free products as no sugar even though it really to me it is a sugar so start reading the labels and avoid maltodextrin

23,my terrible painful heartburn was the best thing that ever happened to me there are three things to do but one of these things that I'm going to share with you will actually correct it let's start with number three you want to add more acid to the stomach like either apple cider vinegar or Bane hydrochloride and that will acidify the stomach and you'll start to feel better all right number two add sea salt to the diet and maybe an electrolyte powder with more potassium because both pottassium and the chloride for the sodium chloride is needed to build hydrochloric acid but the most important thing you can do to correct this problem is to support the valve on the top of the stomach by taking a natural B1 because when you're deficient in thymine which I was you can't produce the acid in the stomach in the first place and of course I was doing so much sugar it was depleting all my B1 and if you want to see the whole video on this go to my YouTube channel and check it out

25,to lose your belly fat there are three tips that you need to know relating to doing intermittent fasting and one of these tips is way more important than the others tip number one make sure you have enough sea salt because if you don't have enough sea salt when you're doing fasting you're going to have keto fatigue you're going to feel tired and weak and you're not going to be able to sleep tip number two do not go into this with any preset fasting schedule instead let your appetite dictate how long you fast for so in other words if you're not hungry don't eat but the most important tip I can give you is this force your body to only burn belly fat 24/7 by reducing your carbs as close to zero as possible and the way that you do that is to combine meat with vegetables skip the breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes muffin sodas and juice and for more intermittent fasting tips check out my YouTube channel

27,if you have any inflammation on the right side of your body okay I don't care if it's fibromyalgia or shoulder pain or a headache on the right side or anything down in the lower part of your body as well suspect something related to the gallbladder and it could be just the bile ducts themselves being congested with what's called bile sludge which a lot of people don't even know about that they they think automatically you have to have a gall stone but not necessarily there could be some sludge which is really the stage before a gallstone develops you start having this super concentrated amount of cholesterol um because there's not enough bile salts

31,"you know I talk a lot about vitamin D but I wouldn't recommend taking vitamin D by itself I would always take vitamin K2 with vitamin D because vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption in your intestines by 20 times and that ends up in the blood so you can have a lot of calcium in the blood which can be a problem for people especially if they're prone to kidney stones or arthritis but vitamin K2 comes to the rescue and that takes the calcium from the blood and pushes it into the bone one of the really important things that vitamin K2 does is to prevent soft tissue calcium from accumulating that could be in your arteries or the joints or any organ so to protect you against any potential side effects of vitamin D3 make sure you take vitamin K2 at the same time as far as the ratios go for every 10,000 I use of vitamin D3 take 100 micrograms of vitamin K2 "

33,all right so today we're at one of my favorite restaurants paries okay so today we have some fries which is a great combination between soy or corn canola oil and a starch under high Heats which is going to create cation that's going to accumulate in the body it's going to build up in the lens of the eye and your brain and the tissues and arteries highly inflammatory okay so we also have this right here which is honey mustard and then we have of course our chicken tenders right now lift up the ingredients for that and this is loaded with MSG now there's a bunch of people out line saying oh yeah they just finally found out to fact checking that it's totally safe well why do they use it to fatten rats they actually have to fatten them up with MSG so monoid glate does increase insulin which means it's going to cause a fat liver and make you gain weight and it's going to make you hungrier and this is why when you start eating this you can't stop all right I will see you in the next video

43,what does acid reflex or silent reflex have to do with your breathing well apparently there's a lot of um sensory nerves in your esophagus that go right to your brain and that will give your brain certain information that it's not getting enough oxygen which will cause you to feel like you have air hunger it will cause you to breathe more and gasp or air it'll cause you to yawn more and when you breathe more sometimes it creates almost not like a hyperventilation but you get too much oxygen and not enough CO2 okay now you would think that would allow you to breathe better but what's interesting about the relationship between oxygen and CO2 is that you need a certain level of CO2 to allow oxygen to go into your red blood cells and so if you have just straight oxygen without enough CO2 you won't be able to get enough oxygen into the cells

65,you know the other day I was shopping at the grocery store and I bought this right here keto friendly Duncan hindes chewy fudge brownie mix right is it too good to be true the answer is yes because when you actually read the ingredients it has a lot of great things but then it says it has modified tapioca starch what is that that is mtto dextrin this is like way worse than sugar on the glycemic index table sugar is 65 glucose is 100 maltodextrin is between 116 and 136 so when they say zero added sugar they're putting this carbohydrate in it that acts like sugar even worse than sugar you see they get you because they say it has zero grams of sugar but the carbs in here are way worse than sugar because they spike your blood sugars worse than sugar so the moral of story is read the ingredients even though it says ketofriendly

81,all right another Factor that's very important is the frequency of eating okay if you're snacking if you're eating between meals if you're even eating three meals a day that can slow things down why because one of the triggers for insulin the fat storing hormone is eating in general so the less you eat the better the less you snack the better any food uh will stimulate insulin and then that will make you a little bit more hungry so we want to get you in a state where you're um burning your fat and you're satisfied and you're not hungry anymore so we want to combine the low carb with eating less frequent like 2 meals a day or even one meal a day that will produce huge effects and because you're not craving it'll make it easier to do

99,really got to be careful of these grains uh and consume only grains if you're going to do grains at all that have no gluten and that would be oat quinoa Millet TEF buckwheat and then just like a nut flour you can use almond flour and anytime you are consuming grains nuts legumes things like that you want to germinate those because you want to get rid of certain antinutrients and one being this phytic acid so what you could do is you simply soak these things in water with 1 tblspoon apple cider vinegar and then let that sit for about 7 to 12 hours okay and then you rinse it out and then you can actually bake with it or cook with it whatever and that way you'll get rid of a lot of the antinutrients because this fyc acid will really block the zinc selenium iron calcium things like that

101,does drinking water actually hydrate you the answer is it depends it depends on what's going on with sodium if you have a lot of sodium in the body and not enough water you're going to be dehydrated but on the flip side if you don't have enough sodium and you have too much water you will also be dehydrated perfect examples let's say it's summertime and you're sweating and you're losing all of this water in sodium and you start guzzling all this water you are literally dehydrating yourself because you're diluting that sodium so sodium helps you retain the water to give you the volume that you need and without the volume your blood pressure drops and you have all sorts of issues so to be hydrated yes you need water but you also need electrolytes especially sodium and this especially is relevant if you have diarrhea or vomiting or you suddenly lose a lot of fluid and electrolytes from sweating you want more information about this check out my video on hydration on YouTube

107,now the second point about probotics is we have to talk about the opposite of a prootic which is an antibiotic um there are things out there that mimic antibiotics as well like glyphosate which is an herbicide in all the GMO foods that you are exposed to and also certain artificial sweeteners can act as an antibiotic as well also antibiotics are grossly overused like for example most respiratory infections are usually viral not bacterial but over 75% of the time doctors prescribe antibiotics for upper respiratory infections most sinus problems are viral okay so if you give an antibiotic to someone with a viral infection guess what it won't work in fact that antibiotic will weaken your immune system so then the virus has an advantage so you might end up prolonging the viral infection

131,the pH in your stomach should be between one and three very very acidic and the purpose of that acidity is to help you break down protein is to help you absorb minerals also uh absorb B12 as well as to kill off pathogens right I'm talking about bacteria fungus parasites that could be in your food okay it's kind of a natural barrier your immune barrier and so as we age we lose this stomach acid people that are taking and acids are putting their pH in their stomach in the wrong direction Because the actual cause of heartburn gir an acid reflux most of the time is this your stomach acids are not strong enough in that valve at the top of the stomach is not closing so you're regurgitating acids

133,to remove fat from your liver just drink this one cup every single day now I know you're saying no freaking way is this going to work but just hear me out it'll make sense most of the fat on our livers is coming because of insulin resistance okay and out of all the things that are very powerful to help reverse insulin resistance apple cider vinegar is at the top of the list what you're simply going to do is take a glass of water and you're going to add one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar my favorite is Fair child's not brags because brags dilutes their apple of vinegar then you're going to add to it lemon juice you can do a tablespoon of lemon juice or just squeeze the juice from an actual lemon the combination of lemon which by the way helps to remove fat off your liver and apple ceter vinegar which helps you with insulin resistance can put you in a condition where your body actually releases the fat from the liver for the complete information of why this works check out my YouTube channel

135,next topic is about carbohydrates if you do a workout and you do a little snack before during or after the workout like a lot of people do they want to get those carbs in there maybe they do a protein bar with sugar or they might do an energy drink Gatorade with sugar you're shutting down the benefits of you know ketosis fat burning as well as autophagy which is the recycling of old damaged proteins in your body the kind of the anti-aging effect so here you are spending all this energy doing this workout and then this little bit of carb pretty much just nullifies the benefits especially if you are trying to lose weight around the midsection it's very beneficial to build up to the point where you exercise in a fasting State maybe eat the next hour or hour and a half or two hours later that would actually give you more improvements

137,sometimes people when they get on the ketogenic diet they feel that the muscles are just flat they kind of lost their size they look dehydrated because um when you do keto at least initially you lose your glycogen stores glycogen is basically the storage of glucose a lot of water and potassium and when you initially cut down your carbs okay you're going to also use up some of your glycogen reserve and you're going to lose water water weight okay and uh then your body's going to burn more fat you're going to get leaner

139,you know slightly older people that were born in the 50s and the 60s like myself notied that there just wasn't as many overweight people back then why is that was it because we ate less saturated fats no is it because we ate Less meat no is it because we smoked or drank less no we actually drank more and we smoked more back then but nowadays we consume high fructose corn syrup seed oils which we didn't nearly do back then because we did mostly saturated fat and the last thing which is very interesting snacking back then we nearly didn't do as much snacking as we do now because what people need to know is every time you snack you spike insulin to a certain degree and insulin is behind so many problems especially with weight

141,so these microbes from kefir actually go into the body and they inoculate or seed your microbes to help you grow more microbes and actually the right balance and the microb from kefir actually can survive the stomach acid whereas yogurt it doesn't survive now there's definitely benefits to Yogurt because it can act like a food for certain things in your gut but kefir actually is a probiotic okay that can help your gut by providing the precursor to melatonin but also it can help lower cortisol which is the main stress hormone 
142,id: HR2ogA32znQ
143,now as you see when you buy biotin supplements or you see them in certain shampoos you'll see very high amounts of biotin now is that a problem uh not necessarily because biotin is water salable can Biotin in a cream or a shampoo be absorbed by your skin and the answer is yes and the benefits of using it as a shampoo or taking it oral as a pill is this if you have a subclinical okay a slight deficiency of biotin you may end up with thinning of the hair hair loss and you may end up with skin rashes primarily of your face now that's a subclinical deficiency okay so this can happen if you just had antibiotics or you just are not fortified with enough of the right microbes or you're just not consuming enough of it from the diet

145,insulin is really necessary it's a normal hormone we want it normal we don't want it too high or too low and unless you're a type 1 diabetic and have you know loss of the the cells that produce insulin usually when you are a diabetic or a pre-diabetic not type one but type two you can have a situation where you have high level of insulin and low level of insulin at the exact same time now how can that be well because the body develops this resistance so in this receptor um you have this blockage so the insulin comes out triggered by carbs goes into the receptor receptor is blocking it so we have low insulin inside the cell the feedback loop actually tells the pancreas to produce more

147,now I've been experimenting with this and I found that I'm getting a lot of recovery after I do uh this cold water immersion I have this unit that I jump into I use this after the workout it seems to be working very very well I have not added that the heat therapy after that but I'm going to experiment with that at some point but if you can add cold after the exercise or even heat whether it's a shower sauna warhole you can increase more benefits especially if you're someone like me that tends to have uh more genetics leaning towards inflammation and that's been my problem even in sports is that I have to be very careful of overtraining and I also have to put a lot of more attention on recovery between the exercise and of course I didn't know this when I was in sports and so I just work out a couple times a day seven days a week big mistake because at the end of the wrestling season I could barely walk

153,to help you lower your blood pressure I recommend drinking one cup of this every single day now before I tell you what this is I highly recommend you also get on the ketogenic diet make sure you have enough vitamin D in your diet as well as potassium but a really simple tea that you can drink every single day to help you lower your blood pressure and it can act as a natural ACE inhibitor is habiscus tea apparently the natural chemicals or compounds in habiscus Te which are called anthro zanthin act as a very powerful ACE inhibitor almost comparable with certain blood pressure medications so try it out there's really no downsides there's no side effects it's very inexpensive and so if this could potentially work that would be awesome

157,so these people that are cutting out red meat they maybe doing chicken breast which has way too many uh omega-6 fatty acids and it's definitely of lesser quality and so is like plant-based protein that's like really low on the list whereas sometimes people think those are clean proteins to help you they're not there's other things you can do too you can do eggs and those are good but if you do eggs make sure they're not raw because the raw can deplete your Biotin and it's not nearly as bio avalable as the cooked eggs another protein that's not bad is uh a real good high quality cheese okay think about it where does cheese come from it comes from milk in nature when does an animal need milk when they're growing why because milk has a lot of growth factors to help muscle building and so a little bit of cheese can do wonders on your muscles for growth and increasing muscle size

163,there are several very important mistakes that people make when they do intermittent fasting the first one is not doing the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting and so it's going to be really hard to get into keto because your carbs are just a little too high the next mistake a lot of people make is eating too much in their eating window your eating window should really only be two meals with fasting in between those meals and also making sure that you don't overeat and stuff yourself which will create a lot of bloating and interfere with your sleep I think most popular uh pattern would be an 18-hour fast and a 6-hour eating window but from a lot of trial and error and working with a lot of people it's very important that your two meals uh be in the middle part of the day not extended too late because the later you eat the poorer quality of sleep you're going to get because your digestive system is constantly working to digest all that food so we really want an early dinner and a late lunch now to get the full information on this topic go to my YouTube channel

165,there's a condition called air hunger okay or another word for it would be dpia which is a situation where you just don't get enough oxygen that can create anxiety and typically people know that it comes from asthma or some like pneumonia or a lung infection or maybe COPD but there's another cause for it that you need to be aware of and it's called silent reflux where there's some acid that's regurgitating into your esophagus creating damage to the nerves signaling your brain stem to gasp air but the more important thing is how you treat it are you going to treat it with a medication or are you going to go with something more natural that has less side effects and one of the best remedies to help heal the esophagus of that inflammation would be chlorophyll and a really good source of chlorophile would be either wheat grass juice or wheat grass juice powder and adding a little water and drinking that through the day for more information on this specific topic go to my YouTube channel and search out air hunger

167,so realize when you eat sugar you're kind of paralyzing your immune system and also when you eat sugar if you're female you're increasing your androgens okay that's there's a condition called PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome that comes from too much Androgen but that's really coming from too much insulin because their diet is too high in carbs and too much Androgen increases something called sebum which is the oil in the sebaceous gland or the oil gland which is the exact thing we're trying to regulate and improve and so the big takeaway is that too much sugar kind of paralyzes the uh immune system and allows these pathogenic bacteria to grow all over the place

171,now listen when you're trying to lose weight many times people have this idea I'm not exercising enough maybe I'm eating too much or maybe I'm just getting older or it's genetics those are really not the big reason there's something else that's a much bigger reason why people just can't lose weight and it's really two things one grazing at night eating those nuts late at night and snacking in between meals whether it's some little snack or some protein bar oh my gosh that snacking or eating between meals is a killer because snacking increases insulin and Insulin blocks fat burning and even if you're snacking on protein it doesn't matter it's going to stop you from losing weight so the big reason is not enough consistent intermittent fasting so just try this for three days just completely stop snacking I will promise you you will lose a lot of weight

200,i want to tell you why europeans have less bloating when they consume wheat products than people in the u.s and it has to do with three things one in europe they use white wheat in america they use red wheat and white wheat has more protein and less gluten now in america they use much more glyphosate okay that's the chemical roundup ready than they use in europe that's something that creates a lot of bloating because it affects the microbes and the last reason is this in america we fortify our wheat with a lot of iron in european countries they don't fortify with iron nearly as much and iron can increase pathogens in the body and create a lot more bloating but if you're in keto you don't have to worry about it because you're not consuming wheat products

222,now if fructose is so low on the glycemic index it's like 19 okay and glucose is so high it's a hundred then why is fructose so bad i mean it's from fruit right well the answer is this fructose is a very very different sugar it's only dealt with by your liver all the other cells in the body can't metabolize sugar so the danger of fructose is the overloading of the liver with sugar and then that increases insulin resistance and that can even cause diabetes

238,so why is it that some people get herpes simplex one when they go out in the sun now you may have been taught that the sun gives you vitamin d and vitamin d is really good for viruses right so why would the sun activate certain viruses out of remission versus sometimes putting them into remission well two reasons one is that the sun has radiation okay and radiation can affect the immune system to a certain degree and vitamin d it tends to suppress an overactive immune system so vitamin so vitamin d in the sun is great for reducing inflammation especially something called the cytokine storm but when it comes down to the virus herpes simplex you don't want to get too much sun and you don't want to take excessive amounts of vitamin d but on the flip side you don't want to be deficient in vitamin d you just need the right amount

244,one of the biggest concerns people have on the ketogenic diet is this fat you know 75 of all your calories should be fat now the reason why you shouldn't be concerned about that is because your carbs are low and when your carbs are low your body can finally burn the dietary fat as well as your own stored fat yet when you're not on the ketogenic plan and your carbs are too high any dietary fat that you consume is not used for energy it's used for fat and on top of that your own fat cannot be used for energy

249,did you know what the number one cause of liver transplant is in the united states it's actually taking tylenol and the problem with the drug and tylenol is that it's in a lot of other medications as well so if a person is taking things like a nyquil for example they're getting the drug from tylenol and it's actually quite easy to create a toxic effect and you should never go above four grams of tylenol in one day in fact you should probably keep it less than three grams just to make sure because if your liver is bad or fatty or inflamed your ability to handle and detoxify poisons are much less

251,you know there's a really interesting study that i saw recently on salt it's actually a low salt diet that increases your risk for a heart attack so if you're consuming less than just one teaspoon a day your risk for heart attack goes up however your risk goes down if you increase your salt intake to two teaspoons per day now this especially applies to those of you on a ketogenic diet because when you start the keto plan you lose a lot of fluid however this does not apply to those people who retain fluid like those on a high carbohydrate diet so up your salt a little bit if you want to decrease your risk of a heart attack

264,now when we're talking about insulin we're talking about your ability to lose weight because if the insulin is too high you're not losing any weight so the goal is to keep your insulin at the lowest level possible so most people know that sugars and carbs and excessive protein can increase insulin but they may not know the only carbohydrate that will not increase insulin is fiber I'm talking about the fiber from leafy greens non-starchy leafy greens so anytime you're on keto you don't need to count those carbs from leafy greens simply because it has so much fiber in fiber doesn't affect insulin now there is one last thing that won't affect insulin and that is pure fat as in pure olive oil as an example so one cool thing about extra virgin olive oil on your salads it just increases the nutrients I'm talking about potassium magnesium folate vitamin C and many other powerful phytonutrients in the extra virgin olive oil

266,we're gonna talk about the seventh reason why you're plateauing with weight loss number one could be that your carbs are just too high you got to bring them down below 30 maybe even 20 grams of net carb a day number two you're eating too frequently you need to start intermittent fasting number three your stress could be too high activating cortisol cortisol will block weight loss number four you're just not sleeping enough and guess what you burn all the fat when you're sleeping number five you're too inactive you need to add exercise now even though exercise only contributes 15 of your actual weight loss it still can add up number six your fat grams or your protein grams are too much if you're consuming a tremendous amount of fat with a slow metabolism bring it down to 75 grams also keep your protein in the moderate range and the seventh reason is your microbiome you're lacking good bacteria if you have enough good microbes in your gut that can help you lose weight

274,tips on sticking to it how do i stick to it and i kind of looked at that and i think within a minute of fasting in keto it's a lot easier to stick with it because the cravings go away and you're not as hungry i think one of the big problems with people is they think they have to always live in the moment live in the present but when it comes to food you want to live in the future because that quick momentary pleasure sensation that you want that instant gratification ends up costing you a lot of problems you know tomorrow the next day in the back of my book a lot of you guys have my book in the last page there's something called conscious eating cards and it's really just one card but you cut it out and front and back side you flip you can fold it together and then put in your wallet or your purse and if you're tempted if you are eating something you know you shouldn't the rule is you have to read this card and what that's going to do it's going to really get you to start looking into the future a little bit more of looking at the consequences and really seeing if it's worth it or not

278,it's about calories am i consuming enough calories when i'm doing intermittent fasting we don't want you to go on a low calorie diet there's a little point that i want to mention that i think will explain why you don't need to do that when you go through autophagy which is the recycling of all this protein and fatty acids and nutrients all these things get recycled when you go to doing intermittent fasting your rdas or your requirements of nutrients actually go they're not as high because your your body adapts and it's becoming very conservative with the nutrients it doesn't waste them anymore you could get by with nine or eight ounces of protein one meal a day because your body's adapted because you're recycling all the protein you're not wasting all the protein you can get by also with probably a lot less potassium i wouldn't necessarily worry about getting massive quantities of every single nutrient if you're doing intermittent fasting because your nutrients will be recycled a lot better

280,if you're thinking about doing intermittent fasting and you're hesitant because it's hard because you're not eating there's a couple things you can do to make it easier number one apple cider vinegar with water if you drink that couple times a day like a tablespoon and a glass of water and drink that you're gonna find your hunger is going to go away because it actually helps regulate the blood sugars and it improves insulin and also a lot of people are doing like decaf teas warm teas you can do all different kinds you know teas that support the liver teas that support the kidney another tip would be to make some of those keto bombs so that way at the meal you are really satisfied the other tip would be to get a little bit more sleep because when you're tired because you didn't sleep oh my gosh it really affects your appetite affects your blood sugars and it's going to be really hard to do it and then the last tip would be when you're eating don't just cram a lot of food down your throat real fast spend your time chewing digesting it so that way you don't add that extra stress down your stomach

284,i wanted to explain what causes palpitations the rhythm of the heart is controlled by electrolytes so it's usually a potassium deficiency it could be magnesium it could be a calcium deficiency or even a sodium deficiency but it's an electrolyte problem so either you're not consuming enough because you're not eating enough salad or it could be you're not absorbing the minerals because you have insulin resistance which is very common and a lot of people have that problem and they don't even know they have it like you're getting tired after you eat or you're having cravings to carbs and that's why you want to do intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet the other cause of palpitations would be low stomach acids and the way you would know you have low stomach acids is if you have heart burn if that's confusing to you what causes heartburn is a lack of hydrochloric acid in your stomach and you need that acid also to digest and absorb the food and pull in those minerals

286,so i wanted to talk about your temperature recently i read one of the posts someone was very cold when they're doing intermittent fasting and so why was this is this normal well when any time you fast whether it's intermittent fasting or just regular fasting you basically drop your core temperature so that's a normal thing just because your body's adapting to not eating and it's going in this conservative mode it's conserving energy so it's normal the thing that you have to realize that this usually happens in the transition phases when you're adapting but not necessarily long term it's not going to slow down your metabolism because i think people have this idea that they have to heat the body to burn fat well did you realize that you could take a cold shower and burn more fat than you would in a warmer weather it's totally going to be fine just have to probably wear warmer clothes as you make this transition you could take more b vitamins specifically nutritional yeast to speed things up as far as to lessen the intensity of the cold

288,how could eating fat actually help you lose your own fat okay it sounds kind of strange it doesn't make sense well first of all fat does not trigger insulin okay so insulin is what makes you fat now if you eat fat all day and just grazed all day long you're not going to lose any weight so the reason why you lose fat when you eat fat is really on an intermittent fasting program because that's really going to bring down insulin and allow you to go from one meal to the next fat is very satisfying too so because if you went on a low carbohydrate diet let's say you're doing 20 grams or 50 grams of carbs and you're doing three to six ounces of protein what else are you going to eat there's you have to have something that you know satisfy you to allow you to go from one meal to the next and that's why low calorie or low fat diets are killer as far as making you hungry and not allowing you to fix hypoglycemia basically fat will help you lose weight because it doesn't stimulate insulin and it allows you to do an intermittent fasting program thanks for watching

290,okay so there's this hormone called growth hormone it's the main anti-aging hormone the problem is as you age it goes down and by the time you hit age 50 it's it's pretty low so you want to do everything you can to increase growth hormone and i'm going to explain a way to boost it by 2 000 percent if you would exercise intensely you would only increase growth hormone by 450 percent but if you were to do intermittent fasting you can increase growth hormone by 2 000 percent it's not even about eating certain foods or whatever it's basically intermittent fasting so you want to at least do 16 hours but work up to about 20 hours of fasting and then you can eat in that four hour window i like like me i'll eat it like one o'clock and then maybe at five sometimes at four and that gives me that those four hours of 20 of like call your eating window and you have 20 hours of fasting so that's the way to increase growth among

292,hey guys i'm back again i want to talk about acceptable fats on a ketogenic plan especially when you're doing event fasting i think there's there's a neglected fat that people don't focus on and that would be olives okay especially the fermented sicilian green olive now what's so special about that olive well you can get it at the health food store probably a regular grocery store will sell it as well but those olives have massive amounts of phytonutrients i mean over the top amazing it's good for bone loss it's good for lowering your blood sugars it has about 85 of it is healthy fat fiber no sugar very low carbs actually i don't think any carbs really well just probably a few but it's extremely great for doing this because you would add the olives in your eggs in your vegetables and your salad whatever and it'll give you that fat to go from one meal to the next that's the tip for today

294,today i want to talk about sleep and the quality of sleep if you do not get enough sleep or your quality of sleep is bad it can really mess with your blood sugars it can actually worsen insulin resistance it can increase insulin and that's why poor sleep will cause you to gain weight and good sleep will help you to lose weight really you need to focus on the sleep by doing several things one would be make sure that you get enough potassium in your diet that's from these things called vegetables right enough vegetables because that calms the pulse right down long walks also helps sleep um making sure that you're not causing anything with your digestive system bloating will do it um getting in the keto intermittent fasting those things help sleep but just realize that if you're trying to lose weight if you're trying to improve your improve your blood sugars if you're trying to handle diabetes for example one big factor is focusing on your sleep alright talk to you later

300,i have another tip and this is on how to increase your metabolism okay the way you want to do it is you want to make sure insulin is working in your body that's fixing insulin resistance and i have a lot of videos on that so that's one way but the other way is through exercise but not just regular on the treadmill there's a couple principles that you need to know the three variables of exercise include duration of exercise intensity of exercise and recovery of exercise out of those three it's really the intensity that triggers the metabolism more than anything else it's not duration in fact if you can shorten your duration of a workout and you can increase the intensity and use your whole body in a workout and make sure the recovery is long enough you can stimulate your metabolism to make that really successful you have to start to implement the intermittent fasting slowly gradually you know you're able to do it like twice maybe even once a day as far as eating and you'll feel comfortable you'll lose a lot of weight and you'll feel really good with your cognitive function

302,i wanted to answer a question someone asked me is it okay to do intermittent fasting on a high carbohydrate diet okay and the answer is absolutely no you don't want to do high carbs with intermittent fasting because chances are you're hypoglycemic which means that as soon as you do this and you go for a period of time without eating your blood sugars are going to crash and because you haven't adapted to fat burning it's going to be a huge strain on your brain and your nervous system you're going to be very moody you're going to be very irritable you'll probably have bad vision your bad memory it's just a strain on the brain because you're starving your brain so it's much better to convert over to ketosis by doing the ketogenic diet low carb and then add gradually add the intermittent fasting into it slowly so you're comfortable and your body is adapted and your brain could run on ketones instead of glucose

306,so people want to know why i don't recommend calcium very often i'm always recommending these other minerals like potassium and magnesium but not calcium why not well calcium is one of those minerals that we get easily and most people have too much calcium and it's in they get stuck in their joints and their arteries so they get harding of the arteries they get arthritis so there's only really a couple situations that i would recommend calcium number one if you get cramps in your calfs or charlie horses okay you need calcium or if you can't sleep and you're trying everything else and you can't get to sleep little calcium before bed works with magnesium and then the last thing is if you have osteopenia which is a pre-osteoporosis or osteoporosis those are the situations i would recommend calcium

308,hey guys i want to talk about a fatty liver if someone has that top roll around their gut or they have a protruding gut there's probably a 99 chance of fatty liver a fatty liver doesn't just come from alcohol there's such a thing called a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which you get it from other things like sugar high fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates okay but let's say you end up with fatty liver the question is what do you do now you're gonna definitely do what i'm recommending in a lot of these videos but there's a certain vitamin that you can take that you can restore the liver pretty fast and that's called choline okay it's associated with the b vitamins but choline is what's called lipotrophic it dissolves lipids or fats off the liver you can get it in a powder and you take it over a period of a few months and you will notice that the fat comes right off the liver of course you also have to stop consuming the things that are causing the fat and start restoring the liver with vegetables all right see you later 
309,id: nLtCTc9-x1M
310,so someone asked me what was my biggest mistake trying to get well um and i thought about it and i thought well basically the biggest mistake was not fixing the basics i was trying to take all these vitamins to try to fix my symptoms when the basics weren't even in i didn't have the basics i didn't know about keto i didn't know about consuming enough potassium i didn't know about insulin resistance as well as i know now so if you're trying to struggle with your health and you're not getting anywhere make sure that the basics are in so if you want to know about that there's a keto course that you can take so you can click down below check it out and get the basics first then see if you really need vitamins at all all right 
311,id: -j-r_mS2wY8
312,okay so if you decide to do intermittent fasting and you do not do keto okay let's say you do your regular higher carbohydrate diet and intermittent fasting you may end up with a lot of problems because if you have hypoglycemia and you have blood sugar problems and you do a fast you're going to feel like crap your brain is going to starve of energy because you haven't adapted to fat yet so here you are going without food and you're going to feel very funky it's going to be really hard on your body because you're going to starve your brain cells of glucose so anytime you do intermittent fasting do it with the keto and do it slowly and gradual so you don't starve your brain instead convert the fuel that you're burning to ketones instead of glucose all right 
313,id: Slsnu0pEcmA
314,hey guys i'm back i just wanted to mention one point about salt i've been talking about potassium and magnesium but there's a lot of false information about salt in general so it's true that you need to avoid table salt this is sodium chloride but you definitely need to consume a little more sea salt because if you're on the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting which you should be you're going to require a tablespoon of salt every single day and if you don't have that salt what will happen yes you'll crave salt but you're going to feel fatigued you're going to feel tired you're going to feel your muscles are going to be weaker so i just don't want you neglect this other mineral that we don't really talk about a lot we're just focusing on potassium and these other things but sea salt is something that you're going to need a lot more of if you're doing a high carbohydrate diet you don't want to consume a lot of salt because you're going to retain water if you do but salt is not a bad thing make sure it's like sea salt maybe the himalayan salt would be great so try that out and see if it doesn't boost your energy alright see ya 
315,id: _u_qNmNNuBQ
316,hey guys here's the thing the number one question that people want to know about keto and intermittent fasting is is that is coffee is tea is taking my vitamins is drinking certain liquids going to bump me out of ketosis and the answer is no it's not now if you add butter and coconut oil to your coffee to make the bulletproof coffee it may stimulate insulin a little bit and so you might want to watch that but typically vitamins liquids are not going to be a problem especially if they have zero sugars a little uh almond milk is not going to be an issue and by the way almond milk with a little stevia in there is quite good so you might want to check that out try to get the naturally decaffeinated teas as far as the coffee try to keep it down to like one in the morning uh one small one because when you drew more coffee can overstimulate the adrenals and affect your sleep all right that's your tip see ya 
317,id: vOpofY2qeYs
318,hey guys all right i have another tip and this one is on an antiviral remedy there is a natural compound that you can destroy the mechanism and it dissolves the outer envelope around the virus because it's a fat layer and so this thing goes in there and dissolves it and the remedy is called monolorin and what is monolauren it's a natural compound in coconut oil it's also in breast milk but you're probably going to get it in coconut oil monolaurin is a super concentrated lauric acid okay so it's a fat a healthy fat it's really good for the immune system but it dismantles viruses and so if you have a chronic fatigue syndrome or some type of flu virus or some type of herpes or whatever but it's also good for resistant type viruses resistant type bacteria so if you want to bulletproof your immune system that's one thing you might want to check out and see if it can help you all right thanks for watching 
319,id: M3P9rc_1hak
320,hey guys i have another tip for you on magnesium uh i don't know if you know about chlorophyll chlorophyll is the blood of the plant it's the green stuff right here okay and chlorophyll is very similar to our own blood but the difference is we have iron and chlorophyll has magnesium so it's green it's a green mineral and magnesium is real good for constipation headaches leg cramps heart rhythmias but it's used in over 300 different enzymes in your body so it's it helps protein metabolism you name it so most people do not get enough magnesium so they have problems with sleep and stress so i've been talking about potassium but magnesium is the second on the list and the way you get it you got it vegetables so start increasing the quantity try to shoot for seven cups at least in the next week each day okay get your magnesium

322,hey guys i'm at a wrestling match right now with a friend's son i don't want to talk about performance and endurance one of the problems with wrestlers is they over train the train seven days a week and that happens with everyone so if you over train you actually minimize your improvements so if you're working out always give yourself at least a day to rest and then the days you rest you could walk but don't exercise every single day all right that's the tip of the day 
323,id: i0kmerCZk54
324,hey guys i know i talked about cholesterol before and a lot of the videos but i want to just mention a couple little points about it that i think is very very important okay when you start to cut down the cholesterol your body will just make more if you eat more your body will make less and just realize that the purpose of cholesterol is to help you make hormones and to help your skin be healthy help the brain function correctly and the nervous system the problem with having a clogged artery for example or plaquing it's not the cholesterol it's the artery that goes bad first and then the cholesterol builds up but it's not the cholesterol and by the way when you talk about ldl and hdl those aren't even that's not even cholesterol okay those are little shuttles that carry the cholesterol in and out of the body in and out of the liver actually so hdl would be the cholesterol that would carry the cholesterol out of the liver and ldl carries it into the liver so we have this constant recycling going on 
325,id: 49kS_26uvS0
326,hey guys i wanted to do a little video on the number one selling vitamin in the u.s okay this vitamin is the most popular vitamin and they sell close to a billion dollars worth of this vitamin okay it might be around the world but it's definitely the majority of it is sold in the u.s and that vitamin is centrum it's not even a vitamin it's made from pure chemicals okay petroleum synthetics artificial this they even put like um msg in it the first ingredient in when you read the label is calcium carbonate that's limestone you could pretty much use it as a paper weight now it's not toxic it's just it's like a filler and so most of that vitamin is a very heavy paper weight so then they have all the other synthetic vitamins so it's not a food based vitamin mineral it's a synthetic isolated chemical version of a vitamin in a very cheap combination so when you buy vitamins make sure it has the food on the label okay it tells you the food it comes from 
327,id: HNm-kBPv0kc
328,so let's talk about the perfect ratio for imminent fasting based on the research that's out there the sweet spot is between 18 and 24 hours of fasting before you mobilize major fat from your fat cells so we're talking about doing intermittent fasting with about a six window of eating and then going all the way to about 24 you could just say it's 23 hours so that would be like one meal a day so two meals with a window of six six hours between like let's say you ate at 12 o'clock and then at six that would start a fasting of 18 hours okay that's when you really start getting in the fat burning then you can graduate all the way to 24 hours or let's say 23 because you have to eat you know once every 24 hours and that would be like just one meal a day and then you got like 20 like close to 24 hours of fasting that would be the ideal scene most of the clients that i skype are doing one meal a day all right see you later

426,all right folks conventional wisdom says if you go on a low carbohydrate diet particularly if you eat a lot of saturated fat which you often do it will lead to your LDL cholesterol Rising well a new study just came out that shows it that is not true in fact the reason that LDL cholesterol sometimes does rise has to do specifically with how lean you are that is to say leaner people see a higher rise in LDL cholesterol than do obese people and in some cases after a BMI of about 35 LDL cholesterol actually goes down so the question remains is being lean and healthy mean you're you're you're sick because your LDL cholesterol goes up does it mean that perhaps you should get fatter does it mean that perhaps you shouldn't go low carb or does it mean that perhaps maybe it's not that big of a deal stay tuned and we'll find out soon take care guys

544,okay question is about endometriosis can a carnivore diet help with endometriosis well the short answer is we have had a number of women where the answer is yes in fact any of these health conditions you know that you that you wonder about almost with with rare exception there's some really rare rare things that we people don't see but most of the more common health conditions you can go to carnivore dot diet and look under success stories and then just type in the word diabetes heart disease back pain you know rheumatoid arthritis you type in the search function and you will find people that will share what they did and how they overcame those particular conditions and yes carnivore diet has helped with endometriosis and diabetes and psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis an Ankylosing Spondylitis and Crohn's disease and also colitis and high blood pressure and up you know on and on and on and on so anyway carnivore.use the search button for success stories okay thanks

546,or somebody asked if I eat fruit on a carnivore diet well no then it wouldn't be a carnivore diet just to be clear with that now can you eat fruit and eat a bunch of meat sure you can and some people do fine with that but that's not a carnivore diet um many people do fine with fruit but many people don't so you just have to kind of see what you're going on you know what you're doing people with diabetes may find it fruit unnecessarily causes too much glucose variability there's other people that have issues with fruit it is not inherently necessarily a bad thing but again it is not part of a carnivore diet but again I'm not suggesting everybody needs to be on a strict carnivore diet it's it's a very useful tool for many many people and it can solve a lot of problems and you know what you ultimately do over the long term it may be very something different but no fruit is not part of the carnivore diet I do not personally consume any significant amounts of fruit uh you know I might have a piece once a year or something like that

548,is carnivore diet safer appropriate for someone who's had their gallbladder out well I can tell you that there are many many people who have successfully done a carnival night without a gallbladder often you know particularly if it's early on you've just had your gallbladder out you might have to play with um decreasing the amount of fat you're exposed to during any one given setting or one one given meal that might be solved by just eating more frequent smaller meals a lot of people who've chronically had their gallbladder bladder out for years will develop the ability to basically have kind of a quote-unquote pseudo gallbladder where the common bile duct actually expands and you have a bile Reservoir that is dumped into the small intestine when you're exposed to you know fat in the diet so I mean for some people it's not an issue at all some people initially during the transition might have to limit how much fat they consume per meal and you can get around that by having smaller frequent more frequent meals eventually most people adapt and can can do fine without a gallbladder so yes gallbladder is fine

550,thank you for doing us and thanks for doing what you do in general to get the word out there I think I am definitely seeing a an incredible growth in this whole Carnival or animal-based movement it's growing and growing I don't think it's slowing down I think I think we're going to reach a threshold Tipping Point to one point where people finally say look we're tired of the BS nonsense it's about how meat is bad for us

552,I didn't even hear about that like embrace the quote I actually am like one of the unique cases of somebody who actually goes to the restroom twice a day some people are going one time a day or one time in five days my digestion is just really Keen right now it's super good you can give me a bunch of steak and I'll turn it into something beautiful and that is I think what we notice people think of your cosplay no no you're just actually absorbing your food it's actually getting to where it needs to be it's not just taking up residence in your colon where I think if you look at how much food is actually wasted on a plant-based diet the organic fruits and vegetables it rot in your fridge and you end up throwing them out but much of the nutrition actually ends up in your toilet because you don't even absorb it there so it's a very inefficient way to consume nutrition whereas an animal-based diet is I don't think I've ever thrown out a steak I go on vacation and I might over buy because I'm cooking my own meals I'm like oh crap I can't take the steak on my plane I better hurry up and eat it or the worst case now I've given it to people I got an exercise 
553,id: 2HBskksF0vQ
554,all right when might you want to be eating sticks of butter well I think outside of maybe early transition periods to ketogenic diets or carnivore diets uh that largely is going to be kind of productive now in the beginning you know when you're having struggles switching over from more carbohydrate-based diet to more fat based diet you're not very efficient at using some of these different ratios you know flooding your system with more fat might be beneficial it does seem to help people with certain neurologic conditions it seems to help people with certain hormonal issues but after a period of time I'm not sure that that benefit persists and it certainly makes it difficult to continue with weight loss efforts for many people you know again the over consumption of fat is a real issue fat is very important we need a decent amount for sure on a carnivore diet and we don't have carbohydrates but you can overdo it so I would just be cautious with people that are you know kind of convincing you to eat sticks and sticks of butter every day that probably is is counterproductive a little bit's okay too much can be a problem all right guys take care 
555,id: Za8ovvljc3c
556,all right when might you want to increase protein in your diet well I think the most obvious time is when you want to put on muscle you know muscles built out of protein you know it's not built out of carbohydrates for the most part that does have a role in there but uh if you're trying to uh you've gotten the point where you lost some weight you want to put on a little more muscle you know you might want to help protein protein is a good thing in my view and I think it's something that most people would benefit from putting on a little more muscle I mean there's there's certainly people that are too fat but there's also a lot of people that are too darn prep and we don't want either of those so uh getting lean putting on muscle protein is is part of that equation I think often it's a big part the most important thing is the training though I don't care how much protein you eat if you don't train you're not going to turn much of it into muscle all right guys let me know what you think we'll talk to you soon 
557,id: 6xNDuioTbOE
558,uh what do I think about the gut microbiome to properly digest plants well I mean there's some truth to that you think about that the only way that we can extract some nutrition that some of these plants is through our microbiome remember uh insoluble fiber in particular which is a lot of component of uh plant food fruits and vegetables and things like that will not break down in our gut by itself so we need that microbiome to be there now the interesting thing about that is meat you don't need any microbiome we are actually designed to break down meat completely without any significant microbiome in fact there's people that don't have a microbiome effectively that have had colectomies or colon is gone they don't have a microbiome they break down meat just fine but the vegetables require that so what does that tell you that vegetables are conditionally able to be utilized for people whereas meat is always able to be utilized by people it's an interesting distinction glad you asked it 
559,id: dVpO6WK6wU8
560,our students asked me do you have to worry about macronutrient ratios well I mean kind of you do I mean you can't just eat pure protein or pure fat so you know I'm talking in the context of carnivore diet and so um you need to get adequate amount of protein to run your you know to to provide structure for the body and just enough enough fat to uh uh you know have energy and so what does that look like for most people for most people on a carnivore diet without carbohydrates most people are going to get between 60 and 80 percent of their calories coming from fat remember a gram of fat is about nine calories and a gram of protein is for some people there's some evidence it might be lower than four but yes so you have to make sure you have fat most people seem to do well in you know over the Long Haul so but if you just eat meat by itself you're probably going to hit those macronutrients without thinking about it alright guys take care 
561,id: nQijIMXR6tg
562,all right question about whether or not I take any uh digestive enzymes on a carbon I personally don't I have no problem digesting meat uh however some people particularly early on particularly if they're coming from a background where they've had some sort of gastrointestinal issue uh low stomach pH or something they've been on suppressive medications for years sometimes may benefit from that so the the the digestive enzymes that I've seen that be perhaps the most effective are typically things like uh betan hydrochloride which will be a to the hydrochloric acid and then the pancreatic enzymes you get pancreatic lipases and proteases that can help you to break down that I'm kind of less inclin to represent I'm sorry to recommend things like uh Ox pile and things like that because I think that often leads to just lots of lipid malabsorption type issues so those two things can be helpful most people only have to do them for a short period of time and that hopefully as they gut sort of normalizes they won't need that remember we're supposed to secrete a lot of acid that's normal for us 
563,id: FPR5ZzO2KM0
564,all somebody says they like they prefer leaner cuts of meat like fillet and flat iron steaks and could bacon be utilized as a supplement to the fat short answer is yes sure you can do that that's fine and I think that's uh that's a reasonable way to do it you got to again at the end of the day no diet is sustainable if you don't like the food so if you don't like riye steaks for whatever reason maybe you got dropped on the head when you're a baby I'm kidding uh you know you do what what you enjoy and that's that's the only way these things work a diet has to be enjoyable for you to to sustain it so so uh Bacon fat is generally fine for for a lot of people you know you may there are other sources of fat out there but uh I've seen a lot of people do very well mixing beef and bacon uh you know there maybe some some exceptions to that but but generally I think that's that's probably fine for for many people

574,all right somebody asked a question about how I maintain electrolytes well I generally sold things to taste I mean I think we have a pretty good feedback mechanism you know you know we tend to seek out salt things taste too salty it's probably more than we need I also you know I will use an electrolyte product called lmnt element uh I use it particularly because I spend a lot of time sweating I I work out quite a bit I'm you know doing Jiu Jitsu so I because I sweat so much I lose probably more electrolytes than maybe the average person does so I do tend to supplement with that that's the only I guess quote-unquote supplement that that I actually take so anyway I hope that's helpful uh take care 
575,id: GjXwO7-y684
576,all right the question is do I stick to any particular macronutrient ratio while on the carnivore diet you know generally I kind of just eat to satiety however as I'm currently in this leaning out phase I'm I'm more conscious of that and so typically I usually eat around 300 grams of protein a day uh you know at maintenance and while I'm leaning out as well uh I'm you know pretty beyond 250 pounds so that's a pretty reasonable amount for me at maintenance I'm eating closer to around 300 grams of fat for a total you know just under 4 000 calories currently leaning out I've driven that down to about 3 000 calories and and so the fat has been reduced by about 100 grams or so so that is currently what I'm doing that looks like about a 60 40 split between protein and uh or fat and protein rather and so that's where I find that I do pretty well where I'm able to get lean other people may find that different ratios work for them but anyway I personally like protein I think protein is good for us to maintain lean mass

582,okay question around tmao a trimethylamine oxide you know what's the story with that well tmao can be elevated for a number of reasons and I think it's the reasons it's elevated is probably more concerning so one reason is chronic kidney disease if your kidneys are not functioning well it doesn't clear the tmao very well and it accumulates in our bloodstream the other reason is chronic gut dysbiosis so if you have a a poor gut function then that could possibly result in the elevation of tmao now those things clearly associated with overall poor health which could certainly explain their relationship with cardiovascular disease now another reason they may be elevated is due to higher consumption of carnitine and choline which are found in animal products meat eggs things like that now if it's elevated do that alone without kidney disease or gut problems it's unclear if that's a problem at all in fact I suspect it's not so anyway those are my thoughts on tmao

590,a lot of people find that it's really hard to over consume steak or meat you know ground beef it's hard to do that where it's quite easy to over consume Donuts or you might even say honey or something like that because that sweetness drives more of the feeding behavior and I think you know you are right humans just at the basic levels want to consume as much energy as we possibly can get in because we don't know if we're going to eat again whereas the reality of the modern day life is yes you're going to be able to eat tomorrow I mean whereas maybe 30 000 years ago that that certainty wasn't wasn't there

602,or what about iron overload and red meat while it is true that red meat is a wonderful and very effective way to obtain iron through something called hemine which is in contrast to the non-heem iron founded plants which is poorly absorbed iron overload isn't typically not caused by eating too much meat typically it is related to metabolic disease remember our iron absorption is regulated by a hormone called hepted which is under the influence of insulin when we are insulin resistant when we are hyperinsidemic we then tend to over absorb iron which then results in excess iron stores it's not the iron that we eat it's the iron that we absorb in a healthy metabolism we absorb what we need and not too much and so I've even seen patients with hemochromatosis which is an iron storage genetic problem actually lower their iron storage on a carnivore diet as their metabolic health health gets better so there you go

604,foreign star tick and red meat algae well it is true it does exist there is a tick that lives primarily in the southeast of the United States recently been seen a little bit more in the Northeast United States usually active between April and August if you get bit there is a chance not always but there is a chance you can develop an alpha gal allergy which means you are basically going to develop some sort of reaction to red meat now the symptoms may be just mild itchiness two full-blown anaphylaxises so the treatment for that is basically obviously avoidance of red meat now the good news is is that this allergy usually will Wane over time it's simply going to last for a year or more in many cases so solution to that is to temporarily you're going to be stuck with things like Duck chicken eggs emu perhaps if you're on a carnivore diet so anyway that that is a real situation a real disease unfortunately fortunately it is pretty rare still I'll do a full YouTube video on this in the coming days take care

613,id: zBSfAQaNFhY
614,okay here's a couple weird side effects from the carnivore diet that some people have reported I've seen some of them myself so number one is the lack of hiccups a lot of people notice that they stop hiccuping after going carnivore so you kind of review that yourself and see if you've noticed that not everybody but many people do a general decrease in skin itchiness a lot of people say they'll itch as much the skin gets healthier um another one is decreased cravings for things like alcohol and cigarettes and things like that a lot of people have noticed that uh they're sort of addictions get better and they're able to stop that and uh a final one is a a general increase in like the growth of like things like males and and uh and hair that grows more rapidly so let me know if you've noticed any of these things or anything else you think is kind of unusual uh unusual side effects all right take care guys

616,a little interesting fact so over the last 20 30 years calorie consumption in the United States has not really gone up appreciably but the Obesity rates certainly have our microbiome actually consumes some of our calories and some studies up to 22 percent of the food we consume is actually eaten by bugs that inhabit our gastrointestinal tract now what dictates how much they consume of course how much food actually gets to them so when we're eating unprocessed Whole Foods more of it passes through our upper digestive tract to get to the lower digestive tract where the microbiome actually eats it when we're eating completely processed food add sugars flowers and things like that it generally gets absorbed more readily in the upper area of the small intestine so we actually absorb more food than we would otherwise consume so it's not how much we're eating but how much is actually being absorbed by us and how much is not being eaten by the microbiome so the other thing about Ultra processed foods is we know that your wires the brain to seek out more of that food so try to avoid Ultra processed food 
617,id: 9A0dO_KRo3E
618,okay after doing the last video on the macronutrients there's a lot of people asking what are you doing to get those macronutrient erasers so you know currently like I said about 300 grams of protein and around 200 grams of fat roughly it's not exact but it's pretty close to that so to get you know almost all the fats coming from ribeye about two pounds of ribeye steak Prime ribeye that you know if you look up a prime USDA ribeye pound has about 100 grams I mean two of those and then the rest of the protein sources the other you know you know uh 180 grams or snow 120 grams or so is coming from lean source of protein things like uh fish things like uh non-fat Greek yogurt that that's what I'm doing to make up the protein and fat macros I mean to be truthful there's a little bit of carbohydrate and some Greek yogurt it's pretty significant it might be you know in an order of 10 15 grams something like that so it's pretty inconsequential but anyway that's what the diet looks like right now to lean out let me know what you guys do to get lean

620,all right let's talk a little bit about uh the macronutrients I'm consuming while I'm leaning out so normally at sort of Maintenance I'm usually sitting you know roughly 300 grams of protein 300 grams of fat that is you know something like 3 900 calories and it is about 69 for those calories come from fat currently I'm eating 300 grams of protein and 200 grams of fat now that seems like a significant reduction in fat and it is about a 900 calorie reduction overall uh but I'm still getting when you do the math about 60 of my calories are still coming from fat so I'm going from 69 to 60 I'm still on a very high fat diet and so on a higher protein diet of course uh and I'm leaning out you know you guys probably notice uh and that's what I'm going to use as a strategy I'm using right now so calories do have a roll even in a carnivore diet they have a role particularly after you've been adapted to it you know I've said that many many times all right let me know what you guys think we'll talk to you soon 
621,id: 8HvEXbTvdx0
622,hey folks as I am currently been leaning up some people ask me kind of what I'm eating what my macronutrient breakdown looks like so just for review got up to around close to 270 uh on Carnivore I'm now coming back down I'll probably end up getting that around 2 40 I spent the last three years focusing on putting on muscle now I'm trying to shed a little body fat and so I'm I'm getting you know getting there not quite quite where we want to be yet but um for instance uh yesterday I ate around 300 grams of protein and 200 grams of fat the fat primarily came from Mostly two pounds of ribeye steak and a little bit of salmon in there and also I had some uh non-fat Greek yogurt that made up the majority of my calories one large meal was a steak and then two smaller sort of snacks and then of course standard working out um and that and that's what I'm doing and so we'll see you know I think we've got another few weeks of this probably get down around 2 40ish and I think it'll be fairly lean at that point and then be time to build some more muscle 
623,id: nxoFpFKAbYM
624,we'll get another common misconception around a carnivore diet is you will become constipated now what is true is most likely if you regret dramatically reduced your fiber intake you go to the bathroom less frequently and your bowel moves will be smaller but generally that's not constipation just because you're not going to the bathroom multiple times a day does not mean you're constipated just means that you are absorbing the nutrition you're consuming rather than shoving it all into the toilet you know all those organic fruits and vegetables you consume much of that nutrition ends up in the toilet so with carnivore pretty much what you consume largely uh in excess of 90 is fully absorbed and so what you end up wasting is much much less so typically that is not actually constipation 
625,id: uLEFrKA7oCo
626,okay here's another mistake I see people on a carnivore diet often doing and this is a very common mistake and one is people do this for the reason of losing weight which is you know Common because there's a lot of people that are struggling unfortunately with too much obesity um and one of the things I see people doing is they just restrict them in a number of calories they consume and they end up lots of craving and binging and unable to stay in the diet so don't try to immediately go on a caramel diet in a massive restrict how many calories you consume because it's going to come back to bite you in the form of not being able to sustain a diet okay so eat enough so that you feel full uh eight enough so you don't want it so that you don't have the cravings and that's how I would start 
627,id: ZdgFUH-o4AI
628,okay here's one mistake that I see people on a carnivore diet doing quite quite commonly one is is trying to quit coughing when you first transition to a carnivore diet now certainly reducing or quitting coffee can be beneficial for many people for some people doesn't really seem to make a difference but when your transitioning a carnivore diet your body is under a lot of stress you're reducing carbohydrate content to basically almost zero uh you're dropping your fiber content from maybe a lot to very little those things have physiologic conferences uh the consequences on the body and can lead to stress now in addition to that having you know caffeine withdrawals with headaches and all these types of things on top of that there's often too much for someone to handle at one time so I would suggest maybe wait three six months until you've just adjusted the diet before you consider if you want to ditch coffee all right let me know how that let me know what your experience has been thanks 
629,id: 6sNH0kTlwhQ
630,okay so the question on the other side of the scale but what about protein what's protein you need well you know I mean I think the US RDA is 0.8 grams per kilogram that's abysmally low no one should be that low that's that's that's like sarcopenia level uh protein levels so I think some of the more recent literature suggest 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram uh I tend to eat higher than a lot of people on a carnivore diet eat a little higher than I think the absence of carbohydrates probably dries a little bit higher protein need for many people so maybe one gram per pound of body grade or 2.2 grams per kilogram somewhere in that neighborhood and some even higher than that so you'll have to play with it and see how you do diabetics you know sometimes too much protein will stimulate glucagon release which can then drive glucose production from from liver via hepatic glycogen eliasis but it's a different sort of a different topic there all right hope that helps 
631,id: iIk4qkYmZ6g
632,okay if you watch the last video the obvious questions well who are the groups that might benefit from an even higher fat diet well certainly uh what I've seen is people healing certain neurologic conditions tend to skew towards higher fat percentages at least for a time that is multiple sclerosis uh you know nerve kind of issues sometimes some of the mood disorders do better with higher fat women sometimes you better with a little higher fat than men so those are a couple examples where you might want to skew to even those higher percentages of fat and then of course you know obviously if you're trying to put on a lot of muscle and size you're going to have to up the protein a bit so anyway let me know what you guys think 
633,id: jvMw4aoiK1E
634,okay people are asking to ask me you know about macronutrient Racers on a carnivore diet well I mean for most people you're going to consume probably between 60 and 80 of your calories by percentage are going to come from fat leaving the rest from largely protein there might be some Trace carbohydrates in there if you eat things like eggs a little bit of dairy but pretty much you know 60 to 80 fat uh that may vary a little bit from there's some people at the extremes at that you know some people with certain conditions might even go a little bit higher fat and then at times you know people want to really try to lean out sometimes they'll go even lower on the fat percentage I typically consume right at about 65 to 7 70 of my calories coming from fat currently I'm kind of leaning out so that percentage is slightly lower uh for instance today I just had a big old two or two two and a quarter pound ribeye probably 200 grams of fat in that thing um and I'll probably have close to 300 grams of protein today all right take care 
635,id: 9kaoG78e9M4
636,all right a follow-up question on the dog feeding video and there's one of them there's Maximus and there's Sasha anyway Sasha's about 45 pounds Max was about 18 pounds um sausage eats about a three-quarter pound of meat A Day Maxima seeds between a third and a half a pound of meat a day I feed them once a day sometimes they'll get a little you know a little treat which are you know meat pieces occasionally but that that generally does it for them and that's that's what they eat every day and uh they've been thriving so hopefully that's helpful let me know what you guys feed your dog goes 
637,id: ljsAwdzkZos
638,did you ask me what I feed my dog goes and see if you can see him in front of me anyway the big one is a white Golden Retriever named sausage about 45 pounds and a little one is Maximus he is a about an 18 pound what's called a cottone de tullier and they basically just eat meat and so I give them a lot of typically leaner ground beef sometimes ground turkey sometimes bits of chicken that's pretty much what they've been eating for the last six years they're thriving on that Sasha is almost uh she's about 11 and a half Maximus is almost eight and they both you know they both do quite well they're they're out here they're out there going to the bathroom and stuff but um that's what I do that one thing I would caution you guys with with dogs as opposed to humans dogs require a lot less fat than humans do just because they have a much smaller brain they don't have the energy requirements per amount of body size that humans do and so unless they're you know sled dogs or something like that but generally if you give a dog a high fat diet you're going to have problems with diarrhea so keep it relatively in what your dog goes 
639,id: H6e_pvCuj-g
640,okay let's talk a little bit about all-cause mortality in the uh relationship between ileo cholesterol and likely apob I think there's more studies on LDL suggestions I don't know if there's much on apob but certainly you know when we when we distinguish between cardiovascular disease cardiovascular mortality it all cause mortality things are very very much different in fact there are many many studies out there that show that you know LDL cholesterol Falls at J curve we're a very low LDL cholesterol is associated with higher mortality there's kind of this middle range and then as it gets very very high there's a slide shift upwards towards mortality I assume the apob curve is going to look very similar and so uh you know again quality of life we're all gonna die of something it's gonna be heart disease it's going to be cancer is it going to be dementia is it going to be violent crime and suicide all these things come into the mix when you're making these decisions so it's not just a you know uh you know a black and white issue which many people have you believe it is even many Physicians 
641,id: VUpFewydSwg
642,so if we have people that are metabolically healthy is defined by the last video are they likely to have heart disease when their apob levels or LDL levels are high well it's interesting there are some a number of cities out there that suggest that perhaps not not not not conclusively not but perhaps not and so there's a large registry and danish heart registry study where they looked at people with zero coronary calcium scan scores and they showed that no matter what your audio cholesterol is from very low all the way up to 190 plus which is considered quite High didn't seem to have any major differences on something called mace or major adverse cardiac events now uh that's that's one there are several other studies out there that seem to suggest something similar that other factors may come in a role there's studies where LDL cholesterol is not associated certainly when you start talking about all cause mortality am I going to die or not die then the discussion it's very very different very quickly 
643,id: 6wJv9qigcMA
644,okay further discussion on LDL or for that matter APO B now for most people a rise in LDL cholesterol or high level of apob is associated with cardiovascular diseases there's pretty clear evidence that certainly shows that but again remember most of that evidence is gained from standard population uh metrics where the average person is eating you know kind of a standard American diet high carb diet so on and so forth they often have a lot of co-morbidities associated with that so what happens with the people that maybe don't have those things that maybe are quote unquote metabolically healthy they're triglycerides alone their HDL is high they're inflammatory markers are low their blood pressure is normalized they have good body composition and so on and so forth although we have any insight into that let me talk about that on another one 
645,id: BOFHJY89xV4
646,uh what if I go on a low carb ketogenic or carnivore diet and my LDL cholesterol goes up well first of all first thing I'll tell you is you should not ignore that just because you're on a low carb diet doesn't mean that it's automatically something we can disregard however there is some Nuance to that and so uh you know the same thing with April would be April B and LDL cholesterol more or less basically track in the same direction the LDL goes up apob is mostly likely going to go up sometimes there's a little bit of discordance where one will go up more relative to the other and a lot of times things like insulin resistance will play a role on that and so there's a lot of nuance here and I'll talk about that in another Another Part here 
647,id: 32JoLDt78yQ
648,all right folks I'm getting ready to head out to Jujitsu there's a couple just a couple uh tips I think are helpful in the context of carnivore diet for athletic performance one is stay on top of your hydration so hydration means fluid plus electrolytes you know electrolytes help keep that water inside you rather than peeing it straight out it's important to have hydrated muscles they perform better also having a little bit of a intravascular fluid is going to help with cardiac output the other thing I think is important is timing of meals uh you know like eating a high protein meal a big like a big old steak that nutrition is going to be hitting your system around three to four hours after ingesting a meal so that's not a bad you know time to do that I'm a little bit late on that today I'm about five hours since my last meal but that's still pretty good all right let me know what you guys say let me see what you let me know what you guys think about what you found to be helpful athletically on a carnivore diet talk to you guys in bit 
649,id: A9Rdr3p863I
650,all right high fat low fat moderate fat what's the best thing for carnivore well the truth be told is it depends uh you know what I have seen is most people end up eating between 60 and 80 of their calories come from fat on Carnival that seems to work well for most people there are some people that will do better on a higher fat version and that often has to do with people with hormonal stresses uh central nervous system or mood disorders those people seem to be better a little bit higher fat for a period of time and then all Lauren it's usually people that are uh you know mostly engaging in strength training uh and need to put on a little bit of muscle and so that's what I typically see so let me know what you guys think 
651,id: C65hjhVe6O8
652,all right let's talk a little bit about gut issues on Carnivore diet the most common reason I see people still continue to have gut issues on a carnivore diet are primarily uh fat consumption and it's usually excessive fat consumption relative to what you can safely or naturally absorb and so that often comes more often in the context of rendered fat rendered fats would be things like grease bacon grease hamburger grease concentrated fats like Butters and creams those often overwhelm our capacity absorb them remember our digestive system is not designed to set up to is not set up to digest concentrated nutrients whether that be powdered flour powdered sugar protein powders concentrated fats and oils that's not what we're designed to do now we can you know we can intuitive capacity handle those things but it's not optimal or ideal and so if you're having a lot of reflux bloating gas diarrhea look at the amount of fat you're eating per meal and perhaps you might want to cut that back 
653,id: n7IDgTx3ym4
654,okay a lot of people consult me with regards to trying to get really lean on a carnivore diet and one of the concepts that I have utilized the so-called concept of fat cycling that is where you focus on three or four days of relatively leaner cuts of meat and then on the fourth or fifth day you add in the fat ear cuts of meat you just repeat that over and over again and that usually is pretty effective for most people I've found now you there's some tricks that you have to do to make that work sometimes and I will talk about that in more detail at other time but basically that concept works pretty well for most people 
655,id: lWF60znL3fk
656,a lot of people ask me about how much do I need to eat on a carnivore diet well I think if you're starting out the first thing you need to do most people you know have some sort of bad eating habits the first thing is eat enough so you don't want the garbage you don't want the pizza the cake the cookies whatever garbage food you're sort of addicted to that is how much you need to eat so you know if you don't want the cupcakes right um the second thing I would look at is kind of protein requirements and so I you know I tend to skew a little bit higher in my protein recommendations for most people I think most people under eat protein so we should probably strive to get something around about a gram for every pound of perhaps ideal body weight so what do you what do you want to weigh eat that many grams of protein typically now some people might need a little bit less than that some might people might do a little more than that and then as far as Fat's concerned fat is your your energy level lover and so you figure out how much you know how do you feel energy wise if you're not if you're not energized you don't feel good your mood is low you might have to increase the fat a little bit all right let me know what you guys think 
657,id: GQskSm1OpXU
658,so I am a Bitcoin hodler just just for for reference and the guys that got me you know same thing who wrote a Bitcoin standard and a guy named Mike Goldstein and they are both carnivores and they've been doing it for longer than I I think that you know obviously when we talk about a lot of people in crypto I know the Bitcoin guys will be mad to say Bitcoin is crypto it's different right that's that's the the thing and I know we just had that what was it the SPF guy and the FDA glow up yep he was vegan by the way which I think are supposedly I've almost was willing to bet that you were going to bring that up well I think you should it's appropriate so anyway you can't trust I don't trust people that don't eat meat I'll just put it that way but anyway I think that with regard to why do we have this crossover I mean a lot of us you know we sort of been jaded about what we've been told about the system you know trust some of these major health care entities you know some people don't trust the central banks you get the same sort of level of mistrust so there's that just general willingness to to to to take The Road Less Traveled 
659,id: zGvTzQYALV8
660,okay final tip on Cravings you know let's say uh you know the the unfortunately none of these uh techniques work that we talked about in previous videos and you just to come you eat you know eat a piece of cake or eat the whole damn cake don't beat yourself up about it guys you know everybody is going to have some ups and downs get right back on the program just you know just as time goes by don't turn it into a week-long binge or a month-long binge or just falling off your your program it you know consistency over time is what matters you know sometimes we have these uh things that that just happen and and don't beat yourself up about it get back on the program and you know the longer that you can go consistently over all the better results you're going to be one one one one mistake is not going to ruin your entire uh Journey on its success all right let me know if these been helpful we'll talk to you guys soon bye-bye 
661,id: 2SAKQTbzCCY
662,all right Cravings let's talk a little bit about those uh first of all um you know there there's a strategy for this that I think works quite well and I call it prevention distraction and then replacement and and so uh many people aren't going on a carnivore diet ask about what do you do with you know if you have sugar Cravings you're craving for some uh you know food that that you know you tend to abuse or or leads to uh uncontrolled binging and things like that well I think the first thing is you know prevention is always the first you know choice right and so how do you prevent Cravings well again eat enough high quality good nutrition so that those Cravings don't tend to appear so you got to eat enough don't you know be restricting yourself all the time eat plenty of high quality meat high quality meat with with adequate fat so that your uh Cravings are at least delayed or minimized okay all right part two coming up 
663,id: r2iiAm4TDgQ
664,okay let's talk about the role of distraction when it comes to Cravings well we know that most Cravings or many Cravings are dependent upon certain hormones the one in particular is gorillin and it tends to be time limited so over a period of time maybe 30 45 minute that craving will pass and so if you can distract yourself for that period of time it can be very effective so how do you distract yourself well lots of things go for a walk on a phone you know engage in a meeting read something also exercise we know acute exercise particularly intense exercise has a very sort of temporary anorexic effect and so depending on the time of day you don't do this for bedtime and sometime during the day go out there hop on a bike do some quick Sprints do something to take your mind off that and take your physiology away from those Cravings okay part three coming up 
665,id: 9z2bytr0Zyc
666,will do a high protein diet or a carnivore diet and they'll notice sometimes that they're serum creatinine number is elevated now in in many cases an elevated serum creatinine could indicate that there's a problem with your kidneys however there are many cases where that's an expected finding and it's not related to uh kidney issues and one is you are having you have a lot of muscle mass number two you exercise quite a bit or number three you eat a lot of protein if any of those three conditions are occurring and you have high serum creatinine probably you don't have any kidney issues now you can you can double check that you can get something called a cystatin c which will be measured independent of muscle mass or protein intake or workout intensity so that may be a way to double check that so in fact whenever I check mine I always check both and always it shows that my serum creatinine is high and yet my substatency is is very much in a normal range so hopefully that's helpful for you guys because your doctor probably doesn't know this stuff unfortunately 
667,id: KJESZPTBgZI
668,all right this is a common question that comes up quite often and it is about whether or not you must consume organ Meats to successfully do a carnivore diet well the answer that is generally no there are some people where they notice small benefit uh perhaps initially uh so what I would say is for most people the answer is no you don't need to mess with it uh if you enjoy them there's nothing wrong with them um also what I would say is don't don't waste your money on overpriced supplements don't don't buy the organ pills if they're just largely a waste of money I would encourage you not to spend your money there but just buy us nicer cuts of meat instead of that and if you enjoy eating set a piece of liver once a week that's great that's fine but don't think you have to to be successful in a carnivore diet because the vast majority of people that have successfully done this cardboard not for years and years and years generally don't include organ meats you know at all or or regularly so anyway hopefully that helps out let me know what you guys think uh take care 
669,id: BbId6ZrM218
670,oh somebody's asking me for a little tip for cooking steak so one thing that I think is an important thing to do is prior to searing a steak always dry it off real well you don't want a lot of surface moisture on this take because what happens is that moisture has to be cooked off and it takes longer to cook the steak longer to sear the steak what happens is you end up overcooking the internal surface so one tip is to weld dry the surface of your steak before you put it on the hot sear all right hopefully that helps let me know if you guys have any tips or tricks you'd like to share about cooking a great steak 
671,id: CTZKaU7urUU
672,hey guys I wanted to share an observation with you that I've seen over the years and one thing I've seen is that Winners tend not to be whiners and whiners tend not to win so the lesson there is when faced with adversity you know whining about it complaining about it is not the answer right the answer is figure out what you can do to overcome that and and let it inspire you in fact I like losing at time because it inspires me to get back after it and to grind and to be able to overcome these obstacles and the more you the more you do that the more you have that mindset the more successful you're going to be over time so stop whining and start winning take care guys 
673,id: Est2D8oIr54
674,Josh and I've been doing this a while and I literally spent every single day of my life talking to people about this stuff and I mean it's almost what happened I seen I mean it's you know mental health gastrointestinal Health osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis skin conditions you know psoriasis eczema mental health issues I mean you know PTSD including I've seen Tourette's Syndrome I've seen genetic disorders like ehlers danlos get better I've seen just about every con you know I fundamentally believe that nutrition affects our health across the board whether it's mental health or physical health or anything and I think generally by improving the quality of nutrition you're almost always going to see some level of improvement to up to including just feeling better to completely kind of reversing disease I see just about damn near everything gets better so it seems like it's kind of crazy to sound like that but that's been my experience foreign 
675,id: HWmnkOcllMA
676,okay a lot of people ask me about should you eat fish on a carnivore diet Well you certainly can and if you're going to eat fish again if you're on a carnivore diet you're not taking any carbohydrates in or very little uh so you need fat you know so fattier cuts of fish so things like salmon mackerel sardines those are all great uh options for people so fish can certainly be part of part of a carnivore diet uh most people tolerate it well there's some people that don't do so well on fish but then generally yes eat fish there's nothing wrong with it go ahead and enjoy it you know some people are concerned about mercury levels honestly that's not the biggest issue out there I mean certainly any environmental Mercury that the fish are exposed to is often counteracted by and sometimes the selenium and fish and so um I don't really see it as a major reason to sway from eating fish if you want to avoid Mercury containing fish and certainly there's things you can do to avoid that there's types of fish that are more prone to that but again fatter cuts of fish tend to be preferred on a carnivore diet just because of the lack of carbohydrates in the back hopefully that helps let me know what you think about eating fish 
677,id: Y-CwTfiDnVs
678,account you should think about as a metabolic disease you know it has a component of metabolic syndrome and often has a component of immunological compromise and so whether or not you eat meat or something else is not really the main considered Factor here now certainly things like fructose alcohol and pure enriched foods can exacerbite gout for sure but if you think about becoming metabolically healthy losing weight improving insulin resistance improving inflammatory markers and typically we see the resolution of gout so initially if you're very inflamed and metabolically on well including more meat in your diet initially provoke a gout but generally over the long period of time what we see is actually got going away and so while you may have to deal with that early on typically over the long course of time gout will resolve and most people quite honestly go carnivore and even if they have a history of gout they don't seem to have a episode of that although some will so my advice manage it symptomatically as you get healthier and healthier gout will tend to resolve 
679,id: G0AHYsKvvoE
680,all right some people ask me what's it after a car or not and ketogenic diet and which one might I want to choose well there are some similarities both are very low carbohydrate both often have a lot of meat in the diet but you know when you're choosing carnivore versus keto I think for people that have severe food addiction issues for people that have certain autoimmune conditions I think Carbonite is superior and I think you know for a lot of people ketogenic diet can be a transition tool to get into a carnivore diet and the carnivore diet you can use for a period of time to often correct a lot of these nutritional problems to help heal gut disturbances that are often very present in many of these conditions so I think a carnivore diet is Superior in a ketogenic diet in many aspects it's much simpler for sure I mean it's pretty damn easy just eat a bunch of meat right so anyway let me know you know what your thoughts are regarding one was keto helpful for you one was carnivore health for you was Carnival Superior to keto in some aspects all right take care guys 
681,id: ycvoDkaKc9s
682,okay does the carnivore diet help prevent cancer well the the answer to that is we have no idea there's no way to really know that but what I can tell you is that a carnivore diet often helps people lose weight uh so they remove obesity from the equation very often decreases inflammation and very often improves glycemic control and very often uh you know helps people with better nutrition all of those things which I just mentioned are all beneficial in either mitigating or preventing cancer so while a carnivore diet we don't know for sure we may never know we do know that it improves multiple factors that are associated with cancer so if you're no longer fat if you're no longer hyperglycemic if you're no longer inflamed you're going to do better generally 
683,id: YYcWJq2HvQw
684,all right what food should you absolutely avoid so the combination of refined grains sugar and Industrial oils that is what you see most common in most processed foods just get those things out of your life and you will definitely improve your health now what you eat besides that is up to you I'm going to suggest you eat a lot of animal products particularly red meat and you can go with that and do with what you want with that so anyway avoid that other garbage and the best way to do it is replace with something that tastes good and satisfies you and nothing satisfies like beef take care guys 
685,id: BZNNQe0SeW8
686,all right let's talk about the top four reasons to eat a carnivore diet well number one it rids us of all Ultra processed foods Ultra processed foods are clearly the cause of most of the diseases that we see particularly chronic diseases number two it is the best source of Highly bioavailable incredibly nutritious protein number three it is exceptionally effective at reducing Cravings particularly people with certain food addictions and number four ribeye steak I mean juice can't beat it just tastes delicious anyway let me know what your favorite reason is for doing a carnivore diet 
687,id: 96xl_E8DtuU
688,all right A lot of people are always asking about the different knives I use to cut up meat so I'll just kind of go through some of this knife here is called an Espada XL and it comes from the company Cold Steel it's quite a nice product this knife is a Damascus steel buoy knife which I got from a company called cry knives out of California I'm sorry out of Canada this is a just a simple slicing knife that I had from a company called Kane Shan I picked it up at Costco as part of a set and then this big boy also was also out of that Kang Shan set from Costco so there you go those are my knives 
689,id: PwM_ZyE4VbM
690,okay let's say you've made the decision to finally get fit you've not exercised most of your life how do you begin well first thing I would say is avoid sedentary Behavior if you're sitting could you be standing if you're standing could be walking if you have a sedentary job get a standing desk or put some boxes up there so you can do your work while standing up most of your expense is going to come through the non-exercise times start doing more walking from there once you kind of start feeling better course change your diet to a you know a non-inflammatory diet whatever that is for you and then you go carnivore that's a good one and then you go on to strength trainings the next thing I would do and then after you've kind of mastered that then you start including some more conditioning type stuff maybe some Sprint edible training High interval training bikes and things like that and then finally we get into explosiveness jumping sprinting uh you know Mobility type stuff so those are those are the orders in which I would proceed anyway let me know how it goes let me know what you're saying 
691,id: AnbuHmgyMrg
692,okay what about feeding your dogs well dogs as you guys may or may not know are uh very heavily carnivorous dogs should be getting meat now uh that meat can contain you know whatever you prefer whatever the dog prefers Maximus gets mostly some chicken and a little bit of ground beef uh if you want to include Oregon Meats in there that's fine but the other thing that's important is dogs do better on relatively leaner cuts of meat you know they just don't have unfortunately sorry Max you don't have big enough brains to require the energy required so humans do so dogs eating meat require you know mostly protein a little bit of fat and dog self-selection studies show that dogs will cell select almost zero carbohydrates so basically meat is what they need means what they should get and that's what's going to make them happy it's going to make you a happy pet owner all right take care say bye Maximus bye-bye

696,all right after seven years of eating a purely carnivorous diet people ask me what what is my favorite cut of steak well time and time again it comes back to the ribeye steak you know it's it's just got enough fat on there uh you know as I think you know from a from a standpoint humans used to hunt big fat juicy animals and that's probably the closest uh we can come to that today so ribeye steak's still my favorite what's yours

698,okay do you have to spend a lot of extra money on the highest quality beef in order to have success on a Carnival diet the answer that is absolutely not people go and buy you know cheap grocery store made from places like Walmart and they've done remarkably well reversing disease and other things now certainly if you want to support local ranchers like like these guys McAfee Ranch out of Montana um it's a great thing to do and I encourage you guys to do that but you don't have to do that and if you can't afford to do it for whatever reason then don't do it for now when you get in a position where you can help these guys out you know these guys are important and vital to our future in the future health of our children and our grandchildren so support your local Rancher when you can but first of all take care of your health

700,all right how much food should I eat on a carnivore diet I know it sounds uh a little goofy but what I will tell you is uh initially particularly those people that are trying to lose weight or are particularly dealing with food addictions eat enough food high quality nutrition so you don't want the other stuff you know eat enough eat enough meat so you don't want a cupcake or a piece of pizza or something like that now having said that what do most people eat well the average male eats somewhere between two two and a half pounds an average female maybe a pound less than that on average don't worry if you're above or below that initially remember our appetite is designed and there for a purpose and when we're feeding ourselves sufficiently uh with with appropriate nutrition our appetite works pretty well it's a problem with this modern processed food is hijacked our appetites where we don't know how to shut it off okay let me know what you guys think 
701,id: ZxhwjPtrlC8
702,all right what up blood pressure and carnivore diet well what usually happens is people's blood pressure normalizes you know high blood pressure often reduces uh it's important uh that you realize that but starting before starting any sort of low carb diet in general because you may need to come off those medications make sure you work with your physician or health care provider to taper those down typically we see the reduction in vascular inflammation which comes with removing sugar other inflammatory items from the diet and so typically we're going to see a reduction sometimes initially you might see an initial increase remember sometimes going on a new diet can be quite stressful it can drive a bit of a cortisol responses so sometimes you'll see an initial elevation but generally over the over over a time period we see reductions or normalization of blood pressure particularly as we lose weight and get metabolically healthier 
703,id: 74lAikKHTac
704,all right what if you're feeling a little tired sluggish light-headed week when you first started carnivore diet well most of the time that has to do with one of two issues either dehydration so you need up your fluid and electrolyte status you know the electrolytes help you to hang on the fluids and then also you're probably just under eating so make sure you're eating enough you know you might have to kind of force yourself to eat enough and those usually take care of it for most people 
705,id: Yz7hgDMAuR0
706,all right what about if you go on a Carnival diet and your serum creatinine level goes up you know that's one of the measures of kind of kidney function well that is something that on a high protein diet is kind of expected you know it's not something that you should be too concerned about um it can indicate kidney issues but mostly a high protein diet is the reason for that and I wouldn't worry about that and so what you can do if you want to test kidney function is test something called a cystatin c and that will account for the fact that you're on a high protein diet and give you a more accurate estimation of your kidney functions 
707,id: OP3xSpsKbEU
708,all right is carnivore diet gonna give me gout the short answer is no it is not now some people eating meat can exacerbate underlying gout now the reason for that is gout is a metabolic disorder you need to fix your metabolic Health you need to lose weight you need to improve your glycemic status you need to improve your inflammatory conditioning and improve your immunological health and when those things occur you can eat plenty of meat so you you know kind of the the cure to this is to eat a high quality diet where uh you know you don't have those issues and you won't have doubt 
709,id: eD3YXBLvYVk
710,okay my thoughts on adding a stick of butter today sorry my thoughts on adding a stick of butter per day to be honest I'm not really a big fan you know I think a little bit of butter for flavoring for cooking is fine I think eating you know pure concentrated fat in many cases can be problematic and I you know like I said it's not something I do and in fact I find I get enough fat from the meat I consume you know if I had to add extra fat um then I would you know typically stick with things like you know beef trimmings and things like that I'm not a big fan of the butter I think it can be you know in addition to cook with a small amount of topping on some steak perhaps but adding sticks and sticks of butter a day to me for most people is not going to be a good idea 
711,id: vbZkul6EZmM
712,okay do I eat vegetables answer that is no I don't like vegetables and never did so I don't bother to eat them now it's not to say you can't have vegetables on your particular diet that won't be a carnivore diet if you're eating vegetables and that's fine you don't have to be on a carnivore diet your mileage may vary depending on how you tolerate them a lot of people are finding out that actually they do better without vegetables despite what we've been told so you'll have to test it out for yourself but personally I don't like them I don't eat them I found no benefits from it all they did was make me bloated and gassy and don't eat them so there you go

714,hey guys X Sean Baker here let's talk about how to quit sugar well first of all I think the best thing to do is complete abstinence you know get rid of the sugar get rid of all the sugary crap get rid of the artificial sweeteners I mean I think that's an important thing and then you got to replace it with something that is extremely nutrient dense it fills you up and that's things like meat so eat enough meat so that you don't want those things in a nutshell that's how you do it 
715,id: pi7Cnj7PDlg
716,do you attribute you breaking the world records to to the diet or do you think you cut you could have possibly broken it on a different diet the diet allowed me to do it more than I would have I mean I'm clear I'm definitely convinced you know like like the time I got was almost solely attributed to due to diet for sure I was definitely stronger with it you know my recovery was better um I could I could train hard every day in fact when I when I broke the world record this is a 500 meter rail I broke it like 10 days in a row I just went down and broke it when the next day I broke it again and I broke it again and I broke it again just because like I'm feeling good I can go faster wow and my recovery was that in fact I broke one of the world records twice in one day and how long were you carnivore at that time I was probably six months something like that I think of something somewhere in that time frame 
717,id: jzhj-djklnQ
718,so I just started reading about all these people doing this crazy you know I'll meet that and I look back and look back in the days of like uh you know some of the old old-time bodybuilders steak and eggs diets Vince guaran and those types of guys I said well I'm just going to try to see what it does do it for 30 days you know and I was pretty impressed I mean I was like man all my aches and pains went away I started feeling better you know this mood was even better than it was before you know after 30 days I said I'll go back to my regular diet and that just didn't feel as good sore joints and didn't my digestion wasn't good so I went back to it about two months later man my strength has started taking off I went from dead lifting uh 415 for like 15 rep you know which you know it was not bad for a 50 year old dude they're pulling up for 20 you know without any more training which I thought was pretty pretty impressive because I could never get past 15 or 16 and I mean I hopped on you know a bunch of meat and a diet of my strength just went up and I saw my like I said I saw my performance in indoor rowing you know go from uh already American record to blasting the world the world record by you know I beat the world record in 500 meters like four seconds I mean it's destroyed it and beat my own records

720,so I'm 53 now when I when I was about 10 years ago I was 43 I was you know starting to see my health decline I mean I was an athlete my whole life I just want to literally won a World Championships in Highland Games you know you want to put a kilt on you throw those big kind of looking telephone poles they call them Capers and you know stones and all this stuff and I was about 290 you know I'm about 240 right now but I was about 290 and I was seeing my health start to decline and I started saying I got it I got to change diet I mean I can't I can't just train you know I can't out train it anymore so I went uh low-fat High vegetable high fiber you know lean protein and I lost weight and got leaner I went from two about 290 down to about 230 235 in about three months

722,problem is researchers say well that's that's the best we can do because we can't do an ethical study we can't do a you know 20 30 year study just feeding people this and randomizing them you know it's just it's just technically you know impractical to do and it costs too much money so they're saying like well that's the best we have so we have to deal with the data and we just you know we'll look where the the trends lie but this is what we accept for nutritional science and so it's really about science in general it's just not a hard science you can't take all your your subjects and you know sacrifice them and cut them open and see what happens that's just not what you can do with humans because it's unethical to do so so we've got this huge huge you know 50 60 70 years of nutritional information which largely is just not very good science

724,if I was to take all the food in the world and I was going to draw a line in terms of food that would potentially bring down knee pain versus food that would uh inflame or activate more knee pain where do you draw that line is it just as simple as meeting and everything else or is there well I mean you certainly can draw the line there and as you probably know I I'm an advocate of a meat-based diet but I think you start with the ultra processed food you know everything all the packaged carbs all the stuff that we didn't need 100 years ago all that stuff is contributing to disease of various types you know it's the thickeners the preservatives the emulsifiers the stabilizers the flavoring The Preserve you know all the artificial colors and flavors all the foods that have all that stuff in there we think they're they're probably causing problems so if you can just go to a whole food diet whether it's he almost hesitates this but a whole food plant-based diet or or whole food diet of some sort you're generally going to see significant improved 
725,id: -1xnSr-Qcdk
726,why did a change in diet have an impact on the knee right and pain and kind of all these aspects I don't think people would connect what you're eating with maybe literally knee pain yeah so the way I was trained and most orthopedic surgeons today are still taught this it's all about mechanics biomechanical forces as we gain weight we you know we magnify how much load is put through the niche on it and the biomechanics are true and so the assumption is you know you got somebody who's overweight they're going to have arthritis as a consequence of them carrying too much weight and the typical progression would be you know somebody come in with knee pain say they're in their 30s and you say well you know maybe lose a few pounds do some physical therapy strikes and things maybe you maybe you hand them some sort of pill a medication an anti-inflammatory drug that goes on for a few years maybe they come back five years later and none of that's really helped that much because they haven't fundamentally changed their their nutrition

730,most people know the food system is broken and they also know the Health Care system is broken but I think you've really kind of focused on like food may be the solution to two of those problems not just either or how did you become so interested in food being a solution given that you have this medical career where like they're more focused on Band-Aids maybe than on actual like first principle Solutions it was very personal to me you know when I was like I said I'm in my mid 50s now sometime early 40s I started to realize that my health was not going where I wanted it to and I was looking at you know what are the possible solutions as a physician I supposedly know how to take care of Health but I realize that that we're ill-equipped to do so with a with a healthcare system that we have and so I started just playing with different different sort of nutritional strategies I was already an athlete I was already kind of maximized that part of the equation which I think is an important part of it but as I you know started to experiment on myself I found what worked for me uh which I thought was great that's great but then I started to have the audacity to try this out on patients

742,it's interesting in the United States in the last 30 years we've had a dramatic increase in the Obesity I'm here in the UK I'm glad to see you're not where we are at the United States yet are you still about noticeable it's about you're about 20 years behind I think I think in 20 years the UK will catch up in the last 30 years it's the data on food consumption United States has shown no increase in food consumption there's no calorie increase in either food availability or calorie consumption and yet our obesity rates have continued to Skyrocket no calorie no calorie increase in no change in activity level yeah that's that's what the date actually shows right now now prior to that from 1960 to about 1990 we saw about a 300 calorie you know per day increase but since 1990 has been flat and obesity rates have continued to climb and the thought is because we're consuming these Ultra processed foods which bypass a lot of the microbiome we absorb more calories we also set ourselves up for gut this biosis gut permeability issues and that drives continued you know weight gain so it's very it's very interesting dynamic 
743,id: SEWL96T7R_U
744,we're seeing this big push towards plant-based we're ultimately going to see with that is a drive to more and more processed food this is why we see people that go on a whole food plant-based diet they do see some improvement in their health the same thing we're happening when we go on a whole food animal based diet the difference is uh with a whole food animal based diet you don't have the issues with fragility healing issues the mental health issues that are often Associated several scientific studies that show that plant-based diets are associated with higher rates of mental health disorders osteoporosis and fractures poor poor healing and then all kinds of different deficiency States stunting in children and so we don't have that on a meat-based diet Harvard University has now done a study on the carnivore diet we've got 2 000 people on the diet something like 92 percent of the diabetics came off their insulin completely 100 of them came off all other injectable medications and I think 84 came off all oral medications which is there's no other intervention for diabetes it works out powerfully so we're seeing some really really neat stuff

750,okay we're often asked about how we can do a carnivore diet and not spend a ton of money you know honestly most people say when they do carnivore diet it's actually cheaper or or they're equal to what they normally spend when you get rid of all the fresh fruits and vegetables that go bad and all the supplements and all the other processed garbage but regardless if you're on a really tight budget you know you certainly can do ground beef you can do things like eggs you can buy big roasts you buy things in bulk on sale freeze them for later you know there's a great app called mygrocery deals.com that can help you find the sale prices so don't hesitate to shop to sales get the best price you can you sometimes you can make a deal with a local Rancher if you have freezer space you can get stuff at a pretty good price but hamburger ground beef is a great great option hopefully that helps 
751,id: tMF__twXRds
752,that a lot of people like to ask about supplement requirements on a carnivore diet honestly I don't think you really need anything quite honestly I the only thing I consume on a regular basis are electrolytes and the reason I do this because I'm I exercise a heck a lot I'm always sweating but outside of that most people probably don't need any supplements now if you have a known condition where you're deficient in something something can can help you can you can you know fabricate animal foods to meet all your vitamin requirements as per the RDA although I'm not even convinced that those are necessary quite honestly from what I've seen I mean chronically we see people eating well below the RDA of vitamin C and yet no one and I mean no one has developed any concrete evidence of scurving and if anybody would have I would have been me and you know last I checked feeling great and doing well is not a sinus Kirby so I think the supplements for most people are unnecessary there may be a few exceptions but you know I think meat is pretty complete guys all right we'll talk to you soon

755,id: kaG0VrENL48
756,okay I'm often asked about should I consume grass finish beef or grain finished beef on a carnivore diet well what I will say is that until proven otherwise and I haven't seen the evidence that there is a big difference in outcomes I would say consume either now there's clearly some nutritional differences between the two some people say it favors grass-fed beef remember a lot of the beef that's labeled grass finished beef in the store is actually not necessarily even grass-fed so it's a little bit hard to decipher that what I will say is that um you know a lot of people say Grassman speak is more expensive and you certainly can do it easier if you contact your local Rancher a lot of times you can get that at a pretty good price so there's that option and I encourage many people to support their local Ranchers but having said that up to this point I have not seen a big difference in outcomes between those consuming grass-finished and grain finish if that changes I'll be one of the first people to tell you guys okay hopefully this helps take care

762,okay do you necessarily go ketogenic when you're on a carnivore diet well the answer that is no not necessarily you certainly can do a carnivore diet so that will put you in this really heavy ketosis that will be based upon what percentage fats you consume how frequent you you eat uh the length of your fasting period and how much exercise you do so it can be ketogenic it does not have to be in fact for most people I don't really have them worry too much about ketones outside of specific indications remember keep the goal the goal the goal is usually some sort of about a composition goal or health goal I mean if we focus on that rather than you know worrying about particular numbers often we do better

764,okay Carnival rules for a type 1 diabetic we do see a lot of people having success with type 1 diabetes on a carnivore diet I think one of the important things to realize is very likely you're going to have to reduce your insulin levels make sure you have a healthcare provider that can help you with that if you're not comfortable making your own adjustments very likely you will need to you know cut back on the amount of insulin you use per meal diabetics still need to a dose for protein and so some people find efficacy in utilizing regular insulin as opposed to one of the New Rapid acting insulins to cover their meals in a lot of cases because it has a much slower onset of effect and lasts quite a bit longer much as does the effect from eating protein or not we see a very slow but steady rise in glucose over a period of four to six hours as opposed to a car basement where you may see that that rise up and down in an hour or so it's a type of insulin the amount of insulin will typically goes is wise to enlist the help of your health care provider as well

782,if you go on a meat-based Elimination Diet a low carb diet you may need to increase your salt intake the reason for this is that when we lower our overall glucose intake we lower our insulin levels our insulin being lower will then cause the kidneys to retain less fluid less salt and for a period of time you may need to up your salts if you fail to do this many people will notice heart palpitations muscle cramps and headaches so

829,id: E0knPzkA8Us
830,are you made a decision to go on a Elimination Diet you got all this food in the pantry and you're struggling what am I going to do with it if I if I throw it out or give it away am I going to lose all this money well look at it this way one is it will greatly increase your likelihood of being successful if you become successful you will save a great deal of money on things like medications and supplements and quality of life will improve tremendously so it's a financial investment for you if you're able to give it away and somebody else can utilize it good for them ultimately hopefully we can get you know most people away from those types of foods but in the long run this is financially an investment for you it may in the short term seem like I'm wasting food but it's really important for your success to get away from those Foods so don't hesitate to give them away find another home for them 
831,id: 5NkXCckG13s
832,hey folks let's take a look at this this should be fun so let's compare what's more nutritious a whole wheat grain-based bread product or plain old ground beef so let's compare these serving sizes to the two and we can see when we put them side by side that the beef has significantly more vitamins and minerals and it lacks a lot of the inflammatory irritants and anti-nutrients that we find in bread so simple advice obviously go with beef rather than bread 
833,id: rMtCbsAymzE
834,let's talk a little bit about dining at home versus eating out and some of the major differences there and so when you go out to eat you often will see that a lot of ingredients are added surreptitiously to your meals that you don't even know that are in there but we'll use an egregious example here this is be would be the comparison of cooking some chicken at home versus going to perhaps say Chick-fil-A and obviously you've got the breaded chicken but if you look at the the list of ingredients that we have here the number of ingredients that goes into a Chick-fil-A chicken nugget is enormous most of that is garbage where a plain one ingredient chicken at home would be far far more healthy if you're into eating chicken anyway that is a lot of ingredients at the Chick-fil-A version my recommendation is you know the majority of your food should be consumed at home stop going out to eat it'll definitely improve your health it'll also save you a lot of money 
835,id: -jbko3VXbKw
836,okay folks did you know they they put grain and a lot of stuff and you don't even know it may not realize that it's a company very very good at sneaking grains in there mostly because they're cheap and they can be very problematic for a lot of people particularly if they have sensitivities to them it can lead to a lot of gut issues and inflammatory issues so if you see ingredients like these maltodextrin dextrose glucose food starch soy sauce plant protein substitutes vegetable starch beer lager ales other alcoholic beverage or grain base grain-based milk substitutes like oat milk rice milk Etc certain processed meats can contain quite a bit of grains and like certain hot dogs cold cuts and imitation Seafood so keep an eye on the ingredients list when you buy that stuff and certainly a lot of sauces stocks bouillon seasonings economists also be produced with grain or grain derived products packaged foods can be very very sketchy so be careful check the ingredients very careful if you're buying those you know my what I often say is just avoid the packaged food 
837,id: v0MLdro4m4U
838,all right can you out extra as a bad diet well in part depends on what kind of exercise you're doing how bad your diet is but in general one of the limitations to that as we get more efficient with exercise in general our body adapts to it and the impact it might have early on going to have a lesser impact over time that's why marathon runners don't completely just disappear they get to a certain size and then they don't get any smaller so there is a limit to how much exercise you can do and again it's very very challenging to overcome an extremely bad diet in fact it's probably impossible so you're going to have to make impacts on both exercise and dietary quality and composition to eventually make a difference there so remember your body will adapt to exercise it becomes more efficient and if your diet continues to say awful I don't care how much exercise you're doing you're not going to overcome that 
839,id: n4yM8IjgMo0
840,probably don't need to be snacking all that much A lot of people particularly people that have metabolic issues either metabolic syndrome pre-diabetes or diabetes snacking can actually be counterproductive it can lead to significant elevations in blood glucose or blood glucose instability which can be problematic and can lead to things like cardiovascular disease you probably don't need to be snacking all the time in that situation okay the snack food industry doesn't want you to know that and a lot of these dietitians that you know are sponsored by these snack food Industries will continue to promote snacking snacking stacking 
841,id: UOa5I0__EfM
842,can you intuitively eat things like Ultra processed food well the short answer is probably not high processed foods mess with your hunger and your fullness hormones in fact they're designed to do that they're designed to be incredibly tasty and they don't typically keep us full so we keep buying more and more of this I would stay away from those things particularly if you're trying to get healthier replace those things with high satiety foods like meat eggs and for you guys that are still eating vegetation certain fruits and vegetables 
843,id: tfQBVcBnfHI
844,okay true or false all condiments are made with these high processed industrial seed oils well the answer to that is actually false there are some Brands out there where they avoid those things you can find things like mayonnaise that might have something like avocado oil in there which is technically a fruit oil there are products that don't contain seed oils sugar dye soy dairy or other potentially harmful ingredients if you're sensitive to those things and certainly you can make your own you know you can use things like herb butter or duck fat again the seasoning are often a place where lots of things like cornstarch or maltodextrin is often hiding so again you may consider making some of those on your own 
845,id: qcAjdJ9ViAE
846,let's take a moment to talk a little bit about anti-nutrients that may be found in legumes well certain amines such as histamines and tyramines can certainly act that way lectins oxalates phytites sulfites and thiols are all into nutrients there's eight of them instead of eating so many harmful potentially toxic anti-nutrients once you eat foods that are rich in nutrients like meat and other Foods certain vegetables can be can be beneficial 
847,id: BBMh_igQ6Qo
848,all right folks what's the number one thing that people do that are successful on a low carb meat based or carnivore diet the number one thing they do is just have fun with it you know find recipes that you enjoy you know have a big cookout incorporate other people into the into your into your uh into your plan buy account go visit your local ranch or go to a low carb conference again remember this should be something that gives you enjoyment if you make it too strict if you burn out you're gonna have trouble with that so have fun with that that's the number one tip I can share with you guys 
849,id: oAngmesFo_c
850,in a previous video we talked about Foods you might want to look for while you're going out to eat while on a low carb meat based out let's talk about Foods you want to avoid and so first of all there are starchy foods like whole grains rice roast or baked potatoes mashed potatoes potato casseroles french fries peas macaroni and cheese pasta salads ravioli rigatoni and other pasta dishes tortillas taco shells and tortilla chips breads croutons breaded and fried Meats cereals oatmeal Corn Flakes things like that toast muffins cakes pastries bagels and other baked goods on and on and then desserts you know unfortunately we'll skip most desserts avoid even some of the fresh fruit bowls you might have to do that diet and non-diet sodas and certain sugar allergen-filled condiments like ketchup teriyaki sauce soy sauce things like that 
851,id: _-EV-VMBQZ0
852,let's talk about vegan vegan jerky versus regular beef jerky and compare some of the ingredients here now I've said before make your own jerky if at all possible get your food dehydrated just put some beef and salt in there and that's perfect and it's going to minimize the number of ingredients it's going to be more healthy but when we compared what's available in the grocery stores as far as meat-based jerkies and we compare it to vegan jerky again it's not even close I don't even know what mung bean protein is I don't want to know I'm not eating it neither should you 
853,id: xIkPOEzHNbA
854,okay true or false almonds are a great source of magnesium well if you look at the nutrition facts on magnesium for almonds it's actually relatively decent but when we actually look at the actual bio availability of that magnesium we find it is actually quite poor it is bound up with a number of different phytotoxins or anti-nutrients found in these plants remember these different anti-nutrients and phytotoxins that these plants produce are there to protect the seed from ingestion they don't want the seeds to be chewed up and destroyed they want them to be planted by protecting that they produce these phytotoxins which will then cause potential damage to any species that would try to eat those things so just be mindful that some people have had issues with high oxalate contents and almonds leading to things like oxalate-induced renal disease or nephritis because these toxins are relatively difficult to access much of the Magnesium passes through our body unabsorbed 
855,id: T2mnlwrhFds
856,all right what's the number one tip to make sure you always have food you need on hand well it's simple just like you would schedule exercise time like you would schedule brushing your teeth or sleeping schedule a time to shop for the food you needs whether you buy it online just make sure you put on the schedule so just schedule it schedule shopping strips schedule reordering food making sure you always have the food you need on hand 
857,id: mLKgYd5OANg

859,id: 2nUrozaXBOs
860,what foods should you remove from your diet to improve your digestion well I think you should consider removing grains legumes and even potatoes all of these have high amounts of fiber proteins and plant toxins that can potentially damage the intestinal lining of your gut this can cause food to leak into your bloodstream the immune system sees these particles as Invaders and attacks them this creates systemic inflammation and over time autoimmune disorders 
861,id: JsbhLMj1RjE
862,are legumes a good source of protein well they're they're certainly not the best serving of legumes may have six to nine grams of protein which is not a great deal amount you can get far more in things like a piece of meat they contain some anti-nutrients which can make the proteins difficult to access things like trypsin Inhibitors and things of that nature they lack essential amino acids they certainly don't come in the appropriate ratios for what we need you know for for a whole complete protein Source like animal foods do and they also contain often a large amount of carbohydrates for those people trying to avoid carbohydrates or for those in which carbohydrates are a problem these are not a good solution at all so instead of eating legumes for protein I recommend easily digested protein-rich meat 
863,id: HwcvMnpj614
864,okay true or false the saturated fat found in chocolate is bad for us well that's an interesting question so much of the saturated fat found in chocolate is in the form of something called steric acid which has been shown in a number of studies to be actually quite beneficial particularly to our mitochondrial Health by improving the health of our mitochondria we improve the health of our metabolism overall and so we have a overall better effect from that so remember maybe some other compounds in chocolate say high amounts of sugar and things like that which may have a deleterious effect but again the saturated fat found in chocolate and also in many other Whole Foods like beef and eggs and other animal products can be quite beneficial for us in the context of its Whole Food

1153,eating this is like smoking a pack of these a recent study found that the amount of toxic chemicals like acryline and alides in a large fry at McDonald's is equivalent to what you get from smoking 25 cigarettes this is because the oils used in the frying of these french fries seed oils like canola and soybean are unstable when you heat them and they sit in the McDonald's fryers and that produces toxic chemicals acryline Alpha Beta unsaturated aldah all these chemicals are associated with cancer just like this if you want to eat french fries cook them in Tallow the same study also explains that saturated fats like those dominant in animal fats do not oxidize do not create the same toxic byproducts when you eat them so the next time you go to eat McDonald's french fries or french fries from any of your favorite fast food place think about the fact that you're basically smoking a pack of cigarettes

1257,you are what you eat here are my thoughts for starters directed by a vegan the primary investigator in the study is a vegan who also is the head of the Stanford plant-based initiative which is funded by beyond meat vegan propaganda you can make an argument that it might have some conflicts of interests perhaps so what did the study actually find the vegan twins lost more weight than the omnivore twins but if you dig more into what actually happened you see that the researchers provided the vegan twins with less calories well that will result in more weight loss and in the examples of dexus scans shown in the documentary the vegan twins lost significantly more muscle mass than the omnivores in many cases resulting in a higher body fat percentage at the end of the study what is presented is the notion that the vegans lost more weight and because of that weight loss they had an improvement in insulin sensitivity but we also know that you can give someone a reduced calorie diet of anything including Twinkies which has been done and that results in Improvement in insulin sensitivity so this is my concern is that this is misleading people and harming them in the long run

1311,if you like butter I've got some really good news for you I recently came across a couple of randomized controlled trials in humans showing that consumption of butter is associated with less inflammation check this out the first study is an 8-week trial in which participants ate about a tablespoon and a half of butter per day at the end of the trial researchers saw multiple inflammatory markers decrease another 12-week trial compared 39 G about 2 and 1/2 tablespoons of conventional Danish butter versus pastured butter and found that both of these Butters lowered hscp a common inflammatory marker in humans butter gets a bad wrap because it has saturated fat but there are multiple meta analyses and studies showing that the consumption of dairy and markers of dairy consumption are consistently associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease and randomized control trials like this in humans consistently show decreased inflammation with butter so don't fear butter butter is a health food and it'll help you thrive

1325,if you take fish oil you need to hear this I think Omega-3s are a valuable part of the human diet but I think there are better ways to get them than fish oils many fish oils including top selling brands contain significant levels of oxidized lipids meaning that the fish oil is spoiled or rancid this creates harmful products or negative chemical reactions in your body especially if you're getting burps that taste like fish that's a good indication that your fish oil is ranid also if you think you need massive amounts of Omega-3 in your diet for cardiac protection consider this analysis of multiple trials with omega-3 supplementation of high doses showing a significant signal toward increased atrial fibrillation cardiac arhythmia with 4 gr or more of fish oil per day that is way too much fish oil in my opinion and I would not be eating fish oil in the first place where should you get your Omega-3s pasture raised egg yolks animal fats like butter Tallow or ghee and the fat in your steak especially if it's grass-fed all of these contain significant amounts of omega-3 fatty acids that can be utilized by humans

1471,green smoothie versus animal-based smoothie I used to love these when I was a vegan they both have nutrients but the nutrients in here not super bioavailable because they're from plant foods like kale and spinach and the problem with the green smoothie is that when you're trying to get your nutrients you're also getting a ton of anti-nutrients things like oxalates with kidney stones phytic acid with vines minerals isothiocyanates which is bad for your thyroid this really doesn't add up when you think about it but animal-based smoothie tons of nutrients because there are organs in here we got some beef organs to get heart liver kidneys feeding pancreas in there with some raw kefir vitamin A choline and Serene taurine CoQ10 riboflavin folate and they're all bioavailable I'm so much more a fan of an anime smoothie than a plant-based green smoothie now

1489,bang energy here's what I think let's look at the nutrition label so it says there's zero calories but the way they get zero calories is by adding sucralose we know that sucralose and Splenda is a problem because it disrupts the gut Flora by interrupting the way they communicate and when you drink something with sucralose along with any carbohydrate containing foods there's good evidence in humans that is going to cause increased insulin and increase glucose leading to pre-diabetic type physiology no bueno bang also wants you to think it's beneficial because it has nutrients like vitamin B6 or niacin or vitamin B12 guess what you can get all of those things in much more highly bioavailable forms along with tons of other good nutrients in something like a steak this is the real bang energy this is just pretending

1573,whenever I talk about fruit you guys always ask me if I worry about blood sugar spikes I don't for a variety of reasons I think that uh blood sugar spikes don't cause pathology for humans sometimes they're a symptom of a problem but I don't believe that eating fruit causes diabetes in anyone if you have diabetes eating fruit may cause your blood sugar to spike more than it would mine as I'm metabolically healthy but that's just a symptom of the fact that your metabolic Machinery is broken so I don't feel sugar that occurs in Fruit I think it's healthy for humans and the insulin Spike that comes with it is healthy helps you conserve electrolytes which are a clear problem on ketogenic low carb diets if you look at somebody on a low carb diet they have massive electrolyte problems because they're not getting any insulin spikes so insulin spikes are healthy for humans so don't fear fruit and these are some of my favorites

1722,is Diet Coke giving you anxiety Diet Coke contains aspartame an artificial sweetener with potentially dangerous side effects in animal models when Aspartame is given to mice at doses way below the equivalent FDA maximum for humans these mice develop anxiety-like behaviors which is heritable and passed on to Future Generations artificial sweeteners like aspartame are found in hundreds of products in every grocery store not just this diet coke and there is very little public awareness of the potential for harm to humans products containing these artificial sweeteners are being sold to us as if they are completely benign and oftentimes even healthier than higher calorie options the truth is that we don't fully understand the potential dangers of these artificial sweeteners like aspartame acek and Sucralose and there's a significant amount of research to suggest they could be very harmful for humans

1726,look at the difference in color between this pasture-raised egg yolk and egg white and this traditional egg yolk and egg white the reason this egg yolk and even this egg white are darker is because pasture-raised chickens get 108 square feet of land to Rome where they can eat bugs and worms and other nutrient-rich foods for the chickens that creates more beta-carotene in the yolk and in the white these cage-free chickens might not be in cages but they're in a barn these won't even get access to going outside and the only things cage-free chickens are eating is corn and soy it's grains that are fed to these chickens and that results in a pale weak egg yolk and a much runnier weak egg white I definitely think that pasture-raised eggs preferably organic corn and soy free are way better than regular eggs eggs are an incredibly nutritious food for humans with tons of nutrients you can literally see the difference in quality between these two eggs based on what these chickens are eating

1796,organs have to be a uniquely valuable food for humans you go to Whole Foods you go to any grocery store Trader Joe's Sprouts whatever you're going to see meat but how often do you see heart or thymus or liver or kidney or spleen or brain almost never for most of those organs testicle ovaries uterus Fallopian tubes none of these organs are at the grocery store so we've just forgotten about them they're just gone they're essentially Shadow banned from our existence because people won't eat them anymore and I get it a lot of these organs are different tastes than we've grown up with unless you grew up in a very ethnic family that was making soups out of these things you may not have a taste for liver and you probably have never had thymus or spleen in your life but our ancestors have always always eaten these Foods so I kind of knew like there's got to be something unique about these Foods there's never been a culture of hunter-gatherers or really a historical culture of humans it's been studied that doesn't eat the organs and usually eat them first and celebrate them there are some cultures in Africa that won't even touch liver with their hands because it's so sacred liver is almost worshiped

1800,plant-based meats are robbing you of nutrients yes it's true it's actually not even debatable this is indubitable there are now multiple studies that show that the ingredients in plant-based Meats specifically things like soy which contains phytic acid raw view of nutrients what nutrients things like iron and zinc that are essential for optimal human health so you're eating plant-based meat thinking that you're being healthier and you're actually getting less nutrients and anything you eat with the plant-based meat is not going to be as bioavailable because the phytic acid in the plant-based meat is going to prevent the absorption of iron zinc and other minerals in those Foods the only other possible argument that vegans can come up with for plant-based meat is that you're saving the environment which is also false because these are carbon positive and we know that regeneratively raised beef like that from White Oak pastures is carbon negative so eating regeneratively raised grass-fed grass-finished beef is better for you in terms of nutrients and it's better for carbon emissions in the planet indubitably

1874,Diet Coke versus Coke Zero what's the difference neither of these has any calories from sugar most people think they're good for weight loss totally wrong these are both horrible for satiety horrible for insulin signaling and horrible for glucose tolerance check this out Diet Coke contains aspartame a substance that has been shown to induce anxiety in animal studies which is heritable anxiety which is passed on for two generations when mice are given small doses of aspartame that are far below the FDA maximum Coke Zero contains aspartame but it also contains acek yet another horrible artificial sweetener that induces neurometabolic changes in animal studies why would you drink sodas with artificial sweeteners that we know can induce neural metabolic changes anxiety in animal models disrupt your gut microbiome disrupt Quorum sensing impair glucose tolerance when you could just eat things like fruit and honey if you want something sweet or coconut water these are not helping you with weight loss they are sabotaging your progress these are both horrible options

2030,don't eat raw egg whites here's why I prefer to eat my egg yolks raw for Taste convenience and preservation of nutrients raw egg whites can create a biotin deficiency they contain a compound called avidin which binds the B vitamin biotin inhibiting its absorption by your body biotin is super important for a healthy metabolism and healthy hair skin and Nails it's found predominantly in animal Foods including liver meat and egg yolks so this is what I do crack the egg into my hand separating the yolk from the white and I will eat the raw yolk and discard the white I don't worry about getting sick from raw egg yolks because they don't touch the outside shell of the egg which is where bacteria would be raw egg yolks are a delicious nutritious and easy addition to your diet just make sure you skip the white and stay radical

2032,raw milk is so much better than pasteurized milk here's why milk is considered raw when it comes directly from the cow without being heated the pasteurization process of factory farmed commercial milk involves heating this to temperatures above 160 degrees Fahrenheit to remove potentially harmful bacteria eating milk to these temperatures causes changes in the Whey proteins and milk that can make them more likely to trigger immune reactions and allergies in humans but if you're not getting Factory farmed milk the chances of contamination are very low I get my milk from a grass-fed grass-finished source of cattle that's very low volume production and very high quality we know that children who grow up consuming raw milk that is not pasteurized even if they don't live on a farm have lower rates of asthma eczema and allergies pasteurized milk retains many of the nutritional benefits of cow's milk but the heating process appears to cause a loss of immune benefits and some problems for many humans

2112,vitamin d pills are not enough yes taking a vitamin d supplement can be beneficial if you live in a place that doesn't get a good amount of sunlight for part of the year but what about all the other benefits of the sun that you can replace with a vitamin d pill what benefits you ask how about nitric oxide that's made in your skin in response to the ultraviolet light from the sun that is essential for the health of your blood vessels and their dilatation we also know that being in the sun true sunlight is associated with rises in sex hormones like testosterone you want optimal testosterone get in the real sunlight a vitamin d pill can't do that and what about beta endorphin the stuff that relaxes us that's essential for a healthy immune system and it helps with wound healing that's made in the sun and not from a vitamin d3 pill these are not enough so what can you do if you live in a latitude where you don't get enough sun in the summer get into a tanning bed i know it's taboo but just don't get burned ultraviolet light from the sun or a tanning bed if you're not in a place where you can get it is essential for human health not enough
