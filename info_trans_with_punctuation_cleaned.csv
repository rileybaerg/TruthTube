do8O1YxzdVg,"if you don't like eating veggies, this video is for you. as a dietitian, one of the most common things I hear is that people don't like vegetables and, honestly, I totally get it, which is why I always recommend preparing them in different ways. for example, make a chopped salad box and use this as a dip for your chips. I'm using cabbage, cucumber, broccoli, avocado. I'm just going to top this with chickpeas and pumpkin seeds and now I'm just going to coat all of the screen goodness and the screen goddess dressing. I came up with that line. that was pretty bad, wasn't it? store bought dressing? because I'm not in a Gordon ramps kind of mood, don't worry if you're the same way. using sore bought dressings will not take away from the nutrient density of your meal. now we're just going to shake now just top of chives, and now you should have a green goddess chopped salad box dip. this way you're still getting in all the fiber, nutrients and fats. but sometimes having a chop that small and eating it with a chip can make it easier and more fun to eat. so easy and so good. I like all veggies, but in this case I like them smaller. that's what she said."
bpsKYwQffes,"if you are not freezing your rice, this is your sign to start. I'm a dietician and welcome back to realistic nutrition tips. if you love having grains like rice and quinoa with your meals but it takes too long to cook, freeze them in portions and heat them up later. you might have heard that reheating rice is dangerous and can make you sick because of bacteria called pilos serus, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea, also popularly known as fried rice syndrome. but this has been blown way out of proportion, and I say this is someone who's obsessive about food safety. is Serve Safe certified, took many food science courses, is Asian and has thoroughly studied every single type of food poisoning. since I used to be an extreme and metaph Bic and stuff like this used to keep me up at night. not the reheating of the rice that makes people sick. it's all about how it was stored beforehand. after you make something like rice, just don't leave it out for too long at room temperature, because that's what makes any food, not just rice, risu, because bacteria can grow more rapidly at those temperatures. all you have to do is cool your rice and Portion it out. I'm using these 1 cup silicone molds so portions are easier to manage, then I just freeze them. I'll do this for my leftover rice, so I don't waste food and so I don't have to cook rice. every time I want to eat it, I'll just add it to my rice container, and whenever I want rice, I'll just pop it in the microwave freezer rice."
9RO83PiuQ-A,"if you don't like cooking and washing dishes but still want a delicious meal, then make a one pot meal in your rice cooker. I'm a dietician and welcome back to realistic nutrition tips. this tip can be extra helpful if you're a college student, someone with limited kitchen space, or even if you're an elderly person who can no longer use the stove. all you need to do is add your rinsed rice and water to a pot and add some veggies like carrots and bok choy. you don't have to use these specific veggies. you can really use any veggies you want. add some edamame and Tofu for protein. then make your sauce. this easy soy Bay sauce is going to be Savory and so delicious. then we're going to mix it, drizzle our sauce over everything, turn our rice cooker on and relax until it's done. after about 20 minutes you'll come back to the most delicious easy meal. if you're feeling extra fancy, top it off with some green onions and sesame seeds. and since I can just set it and forget about it, it gives me more time to do other things like rot in bed or headit up your mom. best part, you can eat it right out of the pot, which means let's clean up so easy."
dI-Be4IehyQ,"you've heard of sheep pan dinners, but have you heard of sheep pan breakfasts? just like any sheep pan meal, there's less cleanup because everything Cooks in one place, and for me, breakfast feels extra satisfying when it's Savory, hot and freshly cooked. so this has become a go-to, especially since it's a lot easier to prepare than it looks. for fiber, we of veggies like onion and bell peppers. sweet potatoes are also a great source of fiber and energy rich carbohydrates. but the star of this meal is eggs, not just because they're a high quality source of protein, but also because they deliver key nutrients that most Americans don't get enough of, such as choline. like most people, you may be Wonder, wondering whether you should be worried about the cholesterol and eggs, and that question is exactly why I'm teaming up with the American Heart Association. though many people used to be worried about dietary cholesterol, current research shows that dietary cholesterol found in eggs doesn't have as big of an impact on total cholesterol and that eggs can be part of a healthy diet. according to the American Heart Association, healthy people can include on average, seven eggs per week as part of a heart healthy diet. so if you're looking for a filling, delicious breakfast, lunch or dinner, try the sheet pan meal and remember that eggs can be part of a healthy diet."
O_7ZvwhzqGg,"if you like salads but hate preparing them, this video is for you. a few months ago, I posted a video about using a veggie Chopper to make a salad box. in then I've gotten a lot of messages from people asking about what different salads to make. so let me show you one of my favorites. first, you're going to chop napa cabbage, then red cabbage. now let's add cucumber, carrots, red bell pepper and chicken for protein. as a dietitian, so many people tell me that they don't stay full after salads, and usually the reason is because they're not eating enough protein and or fat. speaking of froin, I'm also going to add in edamame. now I'm going to use the California Pizza Kitchen tie dressing. if you couldn't already tell, this salad is basically the CPK Tha crunch salad, which is my favorite salad. from there, a gentle reminder that the dressing does not take away from the nutrients in the salad. it's going to help you enjoy eating your veggies and eat more of it than it's a win. now we shake this. I'm going to top this off with some peanuts, Chi noodles- I love a little Crunch- and cilantro. now we have ourselves the most delicious salad box."
Nq0cKpBQq-I,"I'm a dietician and this is what I atat for breakfast. this is truly one of my favorite things to make. first, crack two eggs into a bowl, mix in 3/4 cup of water and a pinch of salt SC into a bowl and cover with Saran, Wrap and steam for 12 minutes. I brought water to a boil in a w, placed my bowl on a steamer rack and covered it, but you can steam this however you want. now it's top with soy sauce, sesame oil and green onions. this is optional, but you can cut through the egg to let the sauce seep through. I'm having this with leftover rice and kimchi and it was so, so good if you're looking for an easy meal."
y6Z8a0CXfuI,"let's make a side dish for our Thanksgiving dinner. I haven't spent Thanksgiving home in Hawaii in over 10 years, but tonight I'm going to the next best thing, which is my childhood best friend's boyfriend's familyes, friend's house. and it sounds confusing at first, but my best friend, who I've known since elementary school, started dating this really nice guy who's really nice family happens to be Japanese and from Hawaii. just like me and my friend, they've been inviting me to their holiday get togethers because they're so kind and also because they know how isolating it can be without a family when you're far away from home. so they've adopted me, which I truly appreciate. and to make things even more exciting, we have the same taste in food because of our similar cultural backgrounds, AKA they also have rice noodles and other Asian food at these dinners. so for Thanksgiving, I wanted to make a traditional Thanksgiving side dish for a Japanese flare. I decided to make spicy Misa glaz brussels sprouts- and you have to trust me on this, because I didn't record anything at this dinner out of respect for their privacy, but it was so good and they were, thankfully, a hit."
2lnzGCLgYyk,"for years, I struggled to eat meals because, even though I had all of the ingredients for a meal, I just didn't have the energy or capacity to put it together. not just because I had untreated ADHD and lacked the executive function to do so, but also because I was depressed. what I'm about to tell you is something that helped me get out of my slump. if you don't have the energy to make a sandwich, you can still eat the parts. so snack on a few slices of turkey. this will give you protein to help you stay satiated. have a few slices of cheese. this will give you some calcium, some fat to digest, fat soluble vitamins and also happiness, because cheese is the best. don't forget the bread. this is carbs, which give you energy. have an apple or maybe some baby carrots- whichever one's easiest for you. both give you some Fiber, which will help you stay regular. I know it seems like obvious advice, but remembering this on hard days really helped me feel my body, because it made meals seem more manageable, and I believe that's what girl dinner was all about: still eating enough to fuel your body, but not having the energy to do more than that, and that's okay. don't get down on yourself for not having the capacity to assemble food to look a certain way, especially if it's going to look all the same to your body."
vwOTxAGg_CY,"if you like salads but hate repairing them, this video is for you.

I've had my veggie chopper for more than two years and this really helps me get in more vegetables. like having my whole salad in here is just so helpful. also, salad Just Hits different when it's chopped. I don't make the rules also gonna add some grilled chicken, because it helps that too, and also I want some protein. after you're done, add your toppings. I'm adding some feta, some sunflower seeds, in my dressing. now I'm just gonna put this back on and give this a shake and now you have an easy Chopped Salad. such a quick salad and so easy to prepare."
3Ql8lfCMEIg,"I'm a dietitian and I'm having dinner nuggets for lunch, and I'm gonna tell you why. welcome back to the series where I show you what I'm eating and why, and I can already see the comments saying: Kylie, you're a dietitian, why are you eating dinner nuggets? that's so unhealthy. as a formerly picky eater, dinner nuggets were my absolute favorite food as a kid and although I've since Diversified my diet, there are occasionally times when dino nuggets just hit the spot. plus, they're so convenient. so let me show you what we could add to them. first, quickly, purpose salad kit. you can use any, but today I'm feeling this one. then I'm going to take my warm whole wheat tortilla, add as much veggies as I can for more of that fiber which is going to keep me Fuller and regular. then I get my dino nuggets, which have some of that protein which is going to keep me more satisfied. you can add more of the dressing or another sauce to this before wrapping it up, but now you have a crispy chicken wrap that's a little more filling and nutritious. also, remember what you can add to, not what you can subtract from, your meals."
ZD21rjVPpl8,"if you hate meal prepping and love miso soup, then you'll love this. I'm back with another mason jar noodle recipe and this one is, as you may have guessed, a miso soup jar. first add red miso- is your base. then add Dashi, which you can get online or at most Asian stores. add tofu as your protein, then some veggies- I'm using spinach and shredded carrots. now add your noodles- as always you can get rice noodles, but I'm using mungu noodles, if you want, adding green onions. store it in the fridge for a quick lunch throughout the week, but when you're ready, bring the jar to room temperature, add hot water and leave it for 10 minutes. I'm adding seaweed because I love that in my miso soup, but you can shake it or invert it to let the music break up and flavors Infuse. it is so good. so"
cME3DsSKKPk,"I saw someone turn this yogurt cup into this really delicious looking snack that apparently tastes like a Snickers ice cream bar. so today we're gonna try it. so first get your vanilla, Greek or Icelandic yogurt and mix it with peanut butter. then you're gonna top it with melted chocolate chips. it's just gonna form this nice layer on top of the yogurt. you can also add chopped peanuts, coconut flakes and flaky sea salt and freeze for around 15 minutes. you should have a fun Chocolate shell that you can break and mix in with the yogurt and peanut butter. let's try it. wow, oh, that's good. this is delicious and it has 20 grams of protein. of course, you should have Snickers ice cream bar if you want that, but this is a great high protein snack option if you love chocolate peanut butter."
No-g-ZcjXNA,"if you're like me and struggled putting dinner together every night, get one of these. I'm a dietitian, and welcome back to another episode of realistic nutrition tips. today we're going to be making a delicious meal in five minutes and we're gonna do it by steaming fish and veggies in the microwave. this is gonna feel weird if you've never done this before and before you say: why don't you just use the oven or stove? if you're a college student living in a dorm, chronically ill, have no stove or oven, have executive dysfunction, or maybe you're just overwhelmed by recipes with a lot of steps, cooking food in the microwave can be the most convenient and quickest way to get food on your table. so after you salt and pepper your fish and cut some slits into it, stir it together, a little bit of olive oil, minced garlic, Italian herbs, lemon juice and paprika and brush it on your salmon, you can add a little olive oil and then season your asparagus with whatever. all you're going to do now is cover this and pop it in the microwave for four minutes. asparagus only takes half the time, so you can just pop it in halfway, but after a few minutes you'll have fully cooked salmon and veggies. I also heated up Frozen brown rice to complete my meal, but this is the final meal. just remember that your meals don't have to be fancy in order to be nutritious. that's so good, so quick and so delicious."
HZcC-NPSXis,"let's check my bag for a hike today. there's one thing about me: it's that I'm the person in the friend group that brings everything that anyone might ever need. and it's not just because I'm a Virgo and I plan everything in my life, but also because it's one time my friend, who's very athletic and spontaneous, picked me up one day and told me we were going on a chill hike and that I didn't need to bring anything, even water. so I trusted him and he ended up taking me on a hike up the side of a steed Mountain. there's no Trail, just Vibes. it was noon, so it was really hot and I ended up passing out from dehydration and exhaustion because we had no water or food. oh, and it could chase this. once we got to the top for my hike today, I have one of my snack packs with roasted chickpeas, chili, roasted pistachios, dry roasted edamame, dried mangoes and pretzels. they should have some carbs to replenish my energy and some protein to keep me going. I also have water, this time liquid IV, which will hydrate me faster than water alone. in the case that this hike is very hot and very strenuous, which is very likely now that it's summer. they have a lot of great flavors, but passion fruit is my favorite one. I also have sunscreen to protect my skin, toilet paper- because you never know- sunglasses, hand sanitizer and my portable charger for my phone. I'm all packed and ready to go. if you're still hoping, this hike is much less stressful than my other one."
ieJ9BbTyvSM,"when my grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's three years ago, I was living five thousand miles away in Boston. I immediately moved to LA to be close to my family in Hawaii, to see her more often and help out as much as I could. I think everyone knows what Alzheimer's is, but no one prepares you for what it truly is. it's saying goodbye multiple times in multiple different ways. whether it's saying goodbye to the last time they'll remember your secret handshake or the last time they'll remember your name. it's a long goodbye that's drawn out over multiple years and is just as painful the last time as it is the first time for older family members. it's taking care of them in the same way they took care of you when you were younger and coping with knowing it will never be the same as it was before. but when the end does come, there's relief in knowing that the person is finally at peace after a long battle. my grandma passed peacefully the other week and I spent the past week and a half at home, offline and with family and friends. tonight is the night after the service, so I'm making dinner for my parents, since they've been exhausted, and in times like these, making food for someone is the perfect way to show them that I love them and that, no matter what happens, I will always love them and care for them too."

I know it looks ridiculous because there's a lot of Greens in there, but trust me, it is honestly so good and this is what it looks like. I'm so excited to eat it. let's try it. um, this is so good."
NXJxsV41ZmA,"I'm a dietitian and I'm meeting spam for lunch and I'm going to tell you why. welcome back to the series where I show you what I'm eating and why. I was born and raised in Hawaii, where spam is one of the most popular foods, but when I moved to the mainland I was told that spam was a gross canned meat that I should completely avoid because it's unhealthy. but if you're like me and you find this unrealistic, because you still want to have spam from time to time because you love it, or maybe it's a more affordable and convenient protein option, let me show you what we can add to it to make it a more filling and nutritious meal. first, let's add some carbs, because we've got to have some rice with our spam. we'll also add some veggies like cucumbers and carrots for more fiber nutrients, our Teriyaki glazed spam for some protein, and egg for even more protein. now just fold it up and you kind of have a more filling spam listed with more nutrients. always remember to focus on one you can add too, not what you can subtract from your meals."
X09MisWUHJY,"what I ate in a day in New York City. I started off my day with my favorite meal in my favorite place, Raku. I got a quinceanero dawn with extra wakame. this is basically my comfort meal, so this always hits the spot. I've been seeing videos of people trying to find the best chicken Caesar salad wrap and my friend recommended cutlets. so I tried their whole wheat wrap and, guys, it was so good. there may not have been as many veggies as you want to see from a dietitian, but I thoroughly enjoy this. for dinner, I went to Bluefin before a Broadway show. I had some crab cakes with kimchi, marinated crab claws, and then miso glazed Bass with broccolini and rice. I've been loving fish this past year, so this was a great dinner. I've been visiting close friends that I haven't seen in years throughout the East Coast these past few weeks, but I'm back and I'm excited to post more videos soon."

I'm a dietitian and welcome back to my series realistic nutrition tips. today we're making a dump and go meal. so basically you just dump everything in a freezer bag, freeze it thought and then just dump it in the slow cooker when you want a meal and before someone says: how does this make things easier if you're already cooking, when you have kids or if you do life or a chronic illness, executive dysfunction, the best thing you can do to set yourself up for success is to prepare ahead of time when you do have the capacity to take on extra tasks. so today I'm going to make my lazy beef and broccoli kind of meal. I added boneless chuck roast, soy sauce, beef broth, garlic, ginger, sesame oil and brown sugar. I'm just gonna kind of mix this around, add some veggies. I chose broccoli. you can do frozen or fresh, whatever is more accessible to you- and that's it. you can also write instructions if you want to make it easier for your future self to remember. but all I have to do now is thaw this overnight and then throw to my slow cooker on high for four hours and then enjoy with rice easy."

I will not stop talking about this tip because even if it had no nutritional value, I would still be eating this dip By The Spoonful. I know it looks big, but this fits in the fridge and if you want to grab something, it's just so easy to snack on and the fiber and protein from this will keep you more satisfied. this doesn't have to be every snack, of course, but it lowers the activation energy needed if you just want something easy and nutritious."

fmU41Ymn86Q,"when I was 13 I briefly had a crush on a guy who was really into football, so naturally he asked if I like football. I wanted him to like me. so I said, oh yeah, totally. and then he said: oh, what team do you like? and since we were talking over aim, I had the chance to Google what are the top US football teams, and Indianapolis Colts popped up. so I told him: Indianapolis Colts. I even read a Wikipedia page on the cold so I could educate myself, just in case he asked any questions. either way, he didn't really like that answer because he was a Pittsburgh Steelers fan and apparently they don't like each other anyways, fast, four to seven years later and I met my current partner and he asked who my favorite team is, and at that point in my life I had already learned to not change myself or my interests for a guy that I liked. so I was honest and said that I didn't follow Sports really closely. obviously he said he was fine with this and he admitted that his favorite team was actually the Indianapolis Colts, since he grew up in Indiana. so my background knowledge actually came in handy because I could actually ask him relevant questions about his favorite team. he then asked how I knew so much about them and I told him the story that I just told you and he thought it was really funny. so I made a cannellini bean dip with garlic, lemon, rosemary and oregano. this is a little close-up. I brought it to a Super Bowl potluck and it was so good."

PNTmE9wiJB4,"last time I showed you how to cook frozen green beans, so today I'm going to show you how to roast frozen broccoli, specifically how to prevent it from getting soggy. toss the Frozen Flora, some olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika. then space them out on a baking sheet. this is key. it cannot be crowded, because they'll just absorb the moisture from the other broccoli. cook for 20 to 25 minutes at 4: 25, and that's it. I love my broccoli recipe and you can't even tell the difference."
7cqh6oOLuao,"I've been seeing videos of people making sorbet out of frozen grapes, So today we're going to try to do that. all you have to do is add Frozen grapes and a little bit of lemon juice, and all we have to do is blend this. this is what it looks like. let's try it out. oh, it's cold. if you're trying to reduce your added sugar intake, I could see how this could be a great snack. it's pretty good."
FQSPN88ZnAk,here are foods I would never buy as a dietitian. I wouldn't buy this because I prefer the barbecue chicken pizza much more. I wouldn't buy this because my mom had a blueberry waffle face when I was a kid and I ate so many that I can't even look at them. I wouldn't buy this because they're too thin and crunchy and the chocolate chunks aren't as big as I'd like. and I wouldn't buy this because I've been more in the mood for everything- Bagels because they're so flavorful.
DKbanV5SCxs,"and this is episode 8 of realistic nutrition tips. instead of buying fresh produce and having it go bad before you finish it, let me show you how to cook some frozen veggies. today, I'm going to specifically show you how to cook frozen green beans. add your frozen green beans and a little water to a pan over medium-high heat, cook for a few minutes or until the water is gone and the green beans aren't Frozen anymore. add a little oil to the pan, some garlic and season with salt and pepper. they're cheaper and they're just as, if not more, nutritious than fresh green beans."
kEOu0kEMFTo,"I like protein bars, but I love my no-bake chocolate peanut butter protein brownie even more, because not only do they have 10 grams of protein, but they're so delicious and so easy to make. let me show you how to make them. you're going to mix together almond flour, two scoops of chocolate protein powder, a fourth cup of cocoa powder, 3, 4 of a cup of peanut butter, one and a half tablespoons of maple syrup and two tablespoons of milk. you can even mix This Together yourself or use like a food processor or blender. I'm gonna transfer this into a lined loaf pan and now you're going to press it down until it's an even layer. it's gonna look a little something like this: and now spread half a cup of melted chocolate chips over the brownie, and now I'm just gonna freeze this for 20 minutes. after 20 minutes, the chocolate should be solidified, so go ahead and cut it into eight pieces. this is what it should look like. let's try it out. um, I'm not saying you should have this in place of a candy bar, but this literally tastes like a candy bar."
DxFc-CWBu_g,"so I saw a video of someone who was toasting their tofu. So today we're gonna try it, but instead of putting the tofu directly in the toaster, like the person was doing, I'm gonna use these reusable toaster bags so I don't cause an electrical fire. I'm using extra firm tofu and I patted it down to reduce moisture, so now we're just going to put it in the toaster. I toasted it for around 10 minutes and bought the tofu sandwich I saw in the video, which is a slice of tofu, naughty cucumbers, avocado, rice, furukake, green onions, another shot of nodi and another slice of tofu. as you all know, I love tofu and I can eat it in any form, so naturally I like this. so the tofu is toasted, but it's still a little spongy. it doesn't have like a crisp texture, but I could see how it could be even better if I put this in the convection oven. definitely try it out if you're looking for a new way to eat tofu."
R2VK5UM6_xQ,"I'm a writing and this is episode 7 of realistic nutrition tips. you can start today- and this is specifically for all my past lovers out there who hate doing dishes. if you're making pasta and want to include a veggie in your meal, add it to your pasta while it's still boiling. since I'm using broccoli, I'm just going to add it around three minutes before my pasta is done. after I've saved some pasta water and drain this, I just made the rest of my meal in the same pot. this way, it'll be easier for me to get veggies in and it saves me time and the extra effort of having to wash another dish easy."
qjpohStyejU,"this is my super easy and quick 30 minute dinner. just kidding, it took two hours, but did you believe me, like how I believe the food blog that told me this wouldn't take longer than three minutes either way? this is my hiya for dinner tonight, and I wanted to specify that because I always see posts of what people make for dinner and get confused as to how they had the time to make all that food, and sometimes they actually go through the effort of following the recipe and I still end up with a Sapar dish. this one was okay, but I just wanted to remind you that you are valid for not spending two hours on dinner every night. you are also valid if a recipe takes you four times as long to replicate. I'm not eating like this every night and that is totally normal."
96w2vyH05-g,"I'm a dietitian and I'm also technically a nutritionist. however, not all nutritionists are dietitians. let's talk about the differences between the two, because there are big differences depending on what country you're in. in the United States, dietitians must meet the following requirements: graduation from an accredited four-year nutrition science degree program, graduation from a master's program starting in 2024. completion of at least 1200 hours of supervised practice in the dietetic internship, passing the national board exam and completion of continuing education. on the flip side, anyone can call themselves a nutritionist because, unlike dietitian, it's not a protective term, which means anyone who calls themselves a nutritionist doesn't have to have any formal education, doesn't have to have any accreditation, and if they aren't a dietitian, they're not allowed to provide nutrition advice for a specific condition. that said, if you have a certain condition and need nutrition advice, it would be best to see a dietitian. of course, there are some nutritionists out there that are knowledgeable. it may work well with you, depending on what you're looking for, but it is extremely important to consider someone's education and difference in training when making a personal decision for your own health."
FnxEWjYEj_4,"so apparently, heart of palms is supposed to be a healthy, low-calorie snack that resembles string cheese. I'm a dietitian and today we're going to try this and talk about this. this is what it looks like, but you can just peel it apart. so just because it looks like string cheese doesn't mean that it tastes like string cheese. it's a very Briny taste. it tastes very much like a root, if that makes sense. I also heard you can put lime juice and tahin on it, so let's try it that way. this is lime juice and tahin, which I feel I can fix anything right. I think it does taste better, but I feel like everything tastes better with lime juice and tahin. though it is a lower calorie snack, it definitely is not string cheese, but on the upside it is loaded with potassium, copper, phosphorus and zinc. in summary, but if you want to try it, you can try it."
psLBKgXQppY,"I'm a dietitian and this is episode 6 of realistic nutrition tips that you can start today. if you want to increase your protein intake, add bone broth to your rice or quinoa when cooking. one cup of bone broth has 10 grams of protein. this way, your rice will be super flavorful and high in protein."
QG6-FQ2U7WI,"I always thought I was lazy, but it turns out I just had ADHD. growing up, I always looked at other people's meal preps and Healthy Lifestyles and, as a dietitian, I thought there must be something wrong with me, since my life didn't look like that, especially since my life is supposed to revolve around food and healthy eating. so I decided to post easy meal ideas and nutrition tips that were realistic for me, in case anyone felt the way that I did. and I was nervous at first because I thought people would laugh at how Elementary it seemed. but people actually found them helpful and would say they were ADHD friendly, and I was so glad my content was inclusive in that way. but I didn't realize it's because I also had ADHD, hence why these tips work for me. glad I have a diagnosis, because I would always feel bad about not being productive enough, which would then make me more anxious, which then made me more unproductive. but now I can understand how to set myself up for Success without going through all these complicated, High effort steps and make some easy, balanced meals that nourish me while doing so. so easy and so."
8US8t96-WEE,"hot take, but breakfast is not the most important meal of the day. dinner is well, at least for me. I look forward to dinner because days have gotten to be overwhelming and dinner is one of the only times I can actually allow my brain to shut off, even if just for 15 to 30 minutes, to enjoy a filling in a hopefully delicious meal while I watch my TV shows or YouTube videos. creating rituals like intentionally taking the time to enjoy dinner helps me appreciate the process of cooking and eating. it serves as a sense of stability and structure in the midst of a chaotic day and helps remind me of what's most important. I feel like rituals like these also make meaning out of the seemingly mundane events in my life that can otherwise seem boring or insignificant. so maybe, when you have a second today, think about the rituals you may have in your own day-to-day life and see if you have any right now that you may not be aware of. and maybe, just maybe, you'll agree with me when I say:"
qzVuvyn4w6Q,"part two of foods I would never buy as a dietitian. I wouldn't buy this because they're much more fun to eat when they're shaped like dinosaurs. I wouldn't buy this because I ate so much of these as a kid that I almost vomited and now I'm scarred. I wouldn't buy this because the box is damaged. and I wouldn't buy this because it's almost Valentine's Day and I'm sure my fiance will buy me some chocolate soon, right?"
uCm007BPvPg,"I'm a dietitian and is what I eat for breakfast, and I promise this only takes five minutes. I cooked quick oats with soy sauce and grated Ginger. after a minute I removed it from the Heat and stirred in white miso. last but not least, I topped it with edamame, green onions, sesame seeds and sesame oil, if you wanted an easy breakfast idea."
TQLTuAPMJtc,"I'm a dietitian and this is day five of realistic nutrition tips. and this is more related to cooking, because sometimes the key to good nutrition is taking steps to learn how to make home cooking more manageable. so whenever you're preparing vegetables, keep a mini garbage can or bowl next to you. this is mine. it opens really easily and I use a biodegradable bag. I know it sounds unnecessary, but it can be the difference between taking a long time to clean up after cooking and saving some time by just emptying your little garbage can or a bowl after you've prepped everything. if you have a biodegradable bag, you can compost the scraps or you can save the scraps and make a nutritious broth. my parents have been doing this for as long as I can remember, and it helps me cooking a little easier because then you won't have to clean up as much afterwards. try it out. I promise it's worth it."
z_2PiGgCYIE,Euro Foods I would never buy as a dietitian. I would never get this because chocolate cake is much more delicious than red velvet. I would never get this because I'm extremely lactose intolerant and will have diarrhea. I would never buy this because I highly prefer smooth peanut butter over crunchy. and I would never get this because I'm Asian and love Japanese rice.
H0f4_XHNRNs,"apparently the raw carrots out that I'm about to show you is supposed to balance hormones. I'm a dietitian. let's see how it tastes and talk about whether or not this works. so first we're going to shave our carrots, then add extra virgin olive oil, some apple cider, vinegar, salt and a squeeze of lemon. let's try it out. tastes fine. first of all, this could be a great way of getting in veggies if you enjoy eating carrots this way. however, there are no studies that have proven that specifically raw carrots can balance your hormones and eliminate toxins. but carrots are nutritious because they're a great source of vitamin A and fiber, which can benefit the body in many ways. so if you want a new way to get in carrots and more nutrients, feel free to try this carrot salad. if you are choosing to eat this, make sure you're adding more to it like a protein source of starch, so you're not just eating the carrot by itself. that'd be kind of sad."
SFLfz3K_21A,"let's make a dish for a cultural food party, so we're all supposed to bring food from our own culture and I really thought about this because, although I'm Japanese, being from Hawaii is obviously a big part of my identity and it's so underrepresented, given how small the population is. so I decided on show you chicken, given it's a Hawaii dish with Japanese flavors, and also because it's easy to prepare and there's going to be around 20 people there and I feel like everyone deserves their own dye, which means I have to cook 20 thighs. so I have 10 dies in this pot and 10 dies in this pot. so right now the chicken is simmering and show you water, brown sugar, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger and green onions. gonna head out now, but stay tuned for the final result. this is what the final dish looks like, with the reduced sauce on it. this is what the final spread looked like, and here's a list of all the delicious food we ate. 10 out of 10 would recommend."

nsN68mzmPrw,"I'm a dietitian and this is day four of realistic nutrition tips. if you're like me, the sheer idea of gathering ingredients for smoothies in the morning to make a smoothie can sometimes be overwhelming, so I like to make it easier for my future self by doing this. it's as simple as portioning out your ingredients to freezer friendly containers. I'm adding frozen blueberries, strawberries, bananas, almond butter and spinach. all you have to do is store them and, when you're ready, add your protein, like Greek yogurt and or Liquid Blend, and you have your smoothie. it only takes a few minutes to prep week, but it goes a long way on those lazy mornings."
AkrXs5WxjT0,"meal prepping can be hard, so let's prep my easy mason jar noodles. let's add the base first, which is chili, garlic oil, soy sauce, sesame oil and vegetable better than bouillon. then add kimchi, snow peas, shredded carrots and bok choy for veggies and Tofu for protein. add your noodles. you can add rice noodles for starch, and all you have to do is bring the jar to room temperature before adding hot water and you have a delicious meal. it's so easy and quick, which is perfect because"
27IqAin0tYw,"I'm a dietitian and these are mindsets about food that need a change in 2023.. I saw someone do a video on this and really enjoyed it, so I wanted to do my own version. just because something is non-GMO doesn't mean it's healthier. that juice cleanse will not detoxify your body. in fact, it'll make it harder for your body to detoxify itself. just because you can't pronounce an ingredient doesn't mean you should avoid it. do you know how to pronounce these words, if not? say goodbye to all foods that contain vitamin d and vitamin B12. and, while we're at it, let's stop demonizing affordable and accessible Foods at random without sufficient evidence and then recommending something that's 10 times the price is the alternative. let's keep mindsets around food and nutrition evidence-based, practical and realistic in 2023."
z9ZwQVUIIkE,"what I did on my last day home in Hawaii. first, I went to the kakaako farmers market to shop local walk around and eat. I got a steamed bow bun, which was so good. then I went to go looks to get okazuya, which is a local style Japanese Delicatessen that sells multiple small dishes. after picking out my meal, I had lunch at the Botanical Garden. this is one of my favorite places in the world. one thing about me is that I can sit in a beautiful place doing nothing at all for hours and be completely happy. so that's exactly what I did. we then went to the beach. I did Sudoku and then took a nap in the late afternoon sun. it was so Blissful. whenever I'm here, I'll always try to watch Sunset every day. it always allows me to reflect on my day while enjoying the beauty of the Aina. I'm so grateful to have spent time here and I already look forward to returning. this is truly my favorite place in the world and I'm so glad I got to share it with you all."
SF9LzyUK5OQ,"every time I come home I visit this Indian vegetarian restaurant. I had a close friend pass away unexpectedly a few years ago and she used to share places. she loved the people she loved, and this was one of the places that she shared with me and the rest of our friend group. we would always gather me at the Banyan tree and enjoy our meal together in nature, so enjoying a meal here with people I love, such as my fiance and our parents, is one of the many ways I keep a presence in my life, even if she's physically gone. this food is light and nourishing and onion and garlic free. today they had chili beans, cabbage, potato, pea Curry, blueberry, halwa salad, papadum rice, Dal, roasted potatoes, steamed veggies and lemon, mint ginger juice. when I say that food is more than just fuel, this is what I'm talking about, because, out of everything, this has been one of the most helpful parts of a long healing process for me, and I'm glad you're here now too, so I can share this place with you. because,"
ACzq2lsX2k8,"as an Asian American, I feel conflicted about my culture, and not because I'm not proud of it or anything, but because I feel like there are aspects of my Japanese and Okinawan culture that I'm not even familiar with, since so many Asian immigrants, including my ancestors, came over to Hawaii to work on the plantations 150 years ago. most Asian people in Hawaii aren't first-gen and, as a result, there are parts of that culture that are just lost along the way. in my case, we don't prepare an entire ossechi, which includes all these Japanese New Year's meals, though we do prepare parts of it. the parts that we do prepare are local versions of the traditional recipes, and I want to start a tradition this year by making ozoni, which is a traditional soup that is served on Japanese New Year's, and the cool thing about ozoni is that the recipe widely varies depending on the region and household, so I made a miso based version and it honestly came out so good. my family loved it and now my parents want me to make it every New Year's. so just remember, if you're not feeling in touch with your culture, but want to, it's never too late to learn more about it and start their own traditions."

Hi. and then Laura saw me and it was like: oh my God, no, don't say that, don't tell anyone. see you later. once you're done cutting the veggies, add salt now rub it into the veggies, set aside for 10 minutes and another Bowl. add sugar, rice vinegar, water and salt. whisk until the sugar is dissolved. see all the water that's collected. the salt draws the moisture out. now we're just going to squeeze this. then we're just going to add it to the other Bowl. now we're just going to mix This Together. quick, easy namasu."

I remember meeting her for the first time over seven years ago, and she brought chopche to my very first Christmas dinner with her family. as the head of a Korean and Puerto Rican household, she often made traditional dishes like chop Jay and pasteles, and I always admired how she, like many other Asian grandmas, showed her love through cooking, even if the dish she was cooking was a dish she was initially unfamiliar with. and now that she stopped cooking as often, I'm hoping to get back to her what she's giving others and make something that I know she'll love. I was initially nervous because it was my first time making this, but I'm happy to say that it was a success."
-UZpmlhPiR0,"everything I ate on my flight home to Hawaii. for dinner I had this garlic pesto and diced tomato, chicken bagel roll with Maui style chips and a Honolulu Cookie Company cookie. The Bagel rule is fine, basically everything you would expect, but I did love this cookie more. a few hours later I got hungry, so I put out my travel snack pack and this is what I pack. I try to bring snacks that are easy on my stomach, but this should be enough protein and fiber to keep me full. I then passed out for the rest of the flight and then I landed. just kidding, it did not look like this when I landed because it was nighttime and you couldn't actually see anything, but I felt like you deserved a better view than this. but either way, I'm so excited to be home. let me know what videos you want to see while I'm here."

I know I'm easily impressed, but I really enjoy this. it was honestly such an incredible experience to be surrounded by people in the aapi community that I've always admired, and I'm just feeling grateful, inspired and very full."

I work my way down and tie my elastic tight around the rod, then just do the same thing to the other side. I'm going to sleep on this and wake up the next morning and all I have to do is release the clip, take off the elastics and take out the rod. I gently run my fingers to my hair and I might blow dry my bangs, but that is."

I'm bringing chicken, bone broth, spinach and soy sauce to a boil, then I'm just going to add my quick oats for one minute before finishing it off with oyster sauce. I'm topping it off with an egg for additional protein and chili oil for a little kick, if you're looking for an easy meal."
8gIWivpcAfw,"so apparently, grapes tossed in lime juice and Jello powder are supposed to taste just like sour candy. I'm a dietitian and we're gonna try this out, so I have washed grapes here and now I'm just going to coat this in lime juice. so now I'm adding the strawberry jello powder to this container and the orange yellow powder to this container. here's what my strawberry grape looks like and here's what the orange one looks like. okay, moment of truth, let's try it out. that was actually pretty good. so this can actually be a fun way to get in more fruit, and it can actually be a little more filling than candy because it has a little more of that fiber. but I wouldn't say that this is just as delicious as sour candy, although this could be an alternative that's lower in added sugars. both this and sour candy can have a place in your diet."
6shs5fSofi8,"I'm a dietitian and I have IBS. let's get my IBS friendly meal for when I'm not feeling well. first, let's make the marinade for a chicken. now. we're gonna let this marinate while we prepare our rice and bok choy. I'm making white rice because it truly is my stomach's best friend in times like these, though I'm used to it. it does suck to have IBS because it can limit your diet and make you feel like you're missing out on Foods, experiences and opportunities. but I have learned that it is possible to adjust your diet and lifestyle to reduce your symptoms. foreign, here we have a Thai Basil cilantro chicken with bok choy and rice. it's delicious and it won't hurt my insides."

I would never then don't, but I will. Instant Ramen can be a quick and affordable base for a meal. to add more protein, I'm going to add eggs and edamame. to bump up the fiber nutrients, I'm going to add some spinach and carrots. to finish it off, let's add some green onions, Noti and sesame seeds, and now we have an easy, delicious meal that feels doable. always remember to focus on what to add to, not what to subtract from your meals."
ksCHUIWJdOM,"I'm a dietitian and here are three foods that I'm avoiding this Thanksgiving. one: cherry pie because I don't really like the taste and I strongly prefer pumpkin pie. two: mac and cheese just because I'm painfully lactose intolerant and this would send me into an IBS flip. you know what I actually might have this anyway. three: cranberry sauce just because I never actually grew up with this, so I don't really like the taste. but I will be saving this for after Thanksgiving when you put together like a sandwich with all the leftovers- because I actually really like this in like a turkey sandwich. just a reminder that there's no need to restrict yourself before your Thanksgiving meal and there's no need to overcompensate the next day just because you ate more than your typical day. enjoy your food and time with loved ones."
IP0bxHmNzp4,"let's make cornbread for Thanksgiving. I didn't like cornbread much growing up, but then I had this cornbread. I always associate it with my grandma because she made it so often and since she has late stage Alzheimer's now, it makes me remember the times where she was able to cook, eat, talk. damn. I did not mean to turn into one of those food bloggers that tells you their entire life story and it's just like give me your lasagna recipe, but during a time like Thanksgiving it really makes you reflect on what you're thankful for, and I have the one. I'm grateful that I live in LA, because that means I get to visit her in Hawaii more often. I'm also thankful for this cornbread because not only is it super easy to make, but it will always be special to me, and I hope it can now be special for you too, just like Grandma made."

Thanksgiving used to be my favorite holiday growing up, but when I went to college it suddenly became the holiday that I liked least, mostly because, as many of you know, I went to school in Boston and I could not make it home to Hawaii for Thanksgiving. my freshman year, this girl was like, oh, are you going home for Thanksgiving? and I was like, no, it's way too expensive for a four day weekend. but I'm really homesick and I really miss my family. keep in mind, I was like tearing up while I said this because I was pretty emotional, and then she was like: oh, that sucks. Thanksgiving is so important and I'm so excited to go home to see family and that's nice, but can you like read the broom? anyways, it took almost 10 years of Thanksgiving away from home, but I'm finally starting to enjoy it again. although I wish I could be with family, I realized that family doesn't have to mean your biological family. it can mean your chosen family, like your friends. today I made a fall salad and I also have cornbread. I hope everyone likes it and I hope you guys have a Happy Thanksgiving."
LaxZ1MN_HII,"are you constipated? well, apparently there's something called an internal shower, which is a drink made of water, chia seeds and lemon, and it's supposed to naturally relieve constipation, just like that. I'm a dietitian and we're going to try this out. so it's supposed to be a glass of water, two tastes, and this is only half a tablespoon. I don't know if you can see this, but it's a lot of chia seeds. let me just show you how much. oh boy, the final ingredient is squeeze of lemon juice. let's try it. so this is not something that I would do, because it doesn't taste good and there's other ways to say regular, though. chia seeds can be a great source of soluble fiber, which can add bulk to stool and help you pass bowel movements more regularly. two tablespoons is a lot for the average person, and that can end up causing more GI issues like bloating and diarrhea. so instead of drinking it straight, it may be more realistic to add it to something like oatmeal or a smoothie and, instead of two tablespoons, maybe start with one and then go from there."
76xHImc2-qc,"I'm a dietitian, and let's me apart for the week. in under an hour we're going to start with making some rice. now we're going to cook our chicken and I promise the next steps are super easy. cook ground chicken, then add veggies like broccoli, snow peas and shredded carrots. while that's cooking, let's make a sauce out of soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, ginger, garlic and whisk. honestly, this is the easiest prepped meal so far."
7aQFot1gb0Y,"so I could get my first two surprise bags from. too good to go. I feel like I've been seeing this all over the Internet recently, if you haven't already seen those videos. too good to go with this app that lets people reduce food waste by letting people buy surprise bags of food from restaurants and you're buying it at a significantly lower price just because this food is unsold, Surplus, so you never know what you're going to get, but from what I've seen, it's usually always a really good deal. let's see what's inside of them. we have a muffin, a delicious smelling brownie, another muffin, a chocolate chip cookie that I just broke, this little pastry and two sandwiches. I got all of this for 5.99 in LA, and that's just one bag. this bag is also 5.99. let's see what we have. oh, a banana muffin, another pastry, something a little more Savory. all of this for under 12. I would say that it was a really great deal and I'm helping reduce food waste, so it's a win-win. 10 out of 10. would definitely recommend."
NnQRppljPtk,"I spent an afternoon at the LA Google YouTube office and here's what it looks like. I first got lunch with Mary Jo, my partner manager at YouTube, and Brittany, my manager. they did so many delicious food stations and everything was free. as someone who has never worked in an office with free food, this was extremely exciting for me. it was hard to pick, but I got a bowl of rice with bok choy, carrots, seaweed salad, kimchi and spicy pickled cucumbers, along with a side salad and chocolate chip cookie. it was kind of spicy, so I, Loki, had a stomachache because of my IBS, but I didn't want to ruin the fun. we started our tour and our first stop was this coffee shop with free drinks, since this office used to be Howard hughes's Hangar. there's a lot of history here, which is highlighted by all these exhibits. they have so many cool rooms, like this Library, nap room, music room and gaming room. yes, I said gaming room. they had so many games. and did I already mention the free food everywhere? because not only did they have free ice cream, cereal, fruit, to go meals and Candy, but they also had drawers of delicious and nutritious snacks. I may or may not have stoned some, because I'm Asian and I love free stuff, but coming from working at a hospital, it's such a different setting and super interesting to see."
1aHZX6UNVts,"so apparently, Frozen Cool Whip is supposed to taste exactly like ice cream but be lower in calories and healthier. I'm a dietitian and we're going to try this out. I have nothing against Cool Whip, but it's still not ice cream. I mean, yes, it is lower in calories, added sugar and saturated fat, but if you want ice cream, you can have ice cream. I understand that lower calorie Alternatives work for some people, but don't feel bad if you're in the mood for the real thing, because ice cream is much more satisfying, which can make a balanced eating pattern much more sustainable in the long term."

I personally find meal prep overwhelming, especially when I'm trying to find meals I like and not get bored of them. but I'm hoping I can figure things out in this series- and hopefully you will too, because I'll include everything I made in each video. I always felt like a bad dietitian for not liking meal prepping and planning my meals and I was like, oh no wait, I'm just a normal person. I also don't like working harder than I have to, and meal prepping is working really hard. but hey, I'm trying to save money and I'm trying to feed myself, so sign me up. foreign chicken with roasted veggies and quinoa, that's good."

wIZXalKXqaA,"rating Foods I had in Amsterdam. I had to try Indonesian food here. I got everything you see on the screen and it was life-changing. I will be incorporating more Indonesian food into my diet. nine and a half out of ten. I also had to try the Stroop waffle. I tried the kletzkop and Oreo flavor- a little pricey but so good. nine out of ten. there was a point where my stomach was feeling a little sensitive, but I had already made reservations. at the Sichuan restaurant I got stir-fried veggies, tofu, egg fried noodles and this was so flavorful yet so easy on my stomach. nine out of ten. one thing about me is that I will always get udon anywhere, including in Amsterdam, and this place did not disappoint. it was unexpectedly authentic and it hit the spot. nine out of ten. we had to get the fries here. I got mines at this order and they were so crispy. love the sauce. eight and a half out of ten. lastly, I had to try the chicken and lebani wrap with red lentil soup because it was so highly recommended and it did not disappoint. I couldn't have too much of the soup because IBS, but both were absolutely delicious. nine and a half out of ten."
Fvh1eJeOupQ,"come with me as I take a cooking class in Paris. before we cooked anything, we visited the local markets and interacted with the local vendors. there, we were able to determine which ingredients were fresh and in season, which then shaped our meal. we spent the next few hours preparing our meal together, while the chef showed us tips and tricks to prepare each dish. we had razor clams and fresh bread to start off. this is footage of us soaking the clams in water before cooking them. then we had sauteed chantrals and grilled porcini mushrooms. our main was roasted lamb shoulder with corn feed, fennel and green plums, and the lamb was so tender and paired perfectly with a fennel and plums. we then had a cheese board with bread and ended the meal with a citrus curd and seasonal figs. I'm gonna be honest: everything I ate today was pretty new for me, so this was such a cool experience. 10 out of 10 would recommend."
36gbl51LLDA,"reading meals I had in London. this chicken kebab was so full of flavor so I'm giving it a nine and a half out of ten. I'm docking it half a point because it was a little spicy and my stomach needed to rest after this, but that was entirely my fault. these eggs with the salad was a 9 out of ten. the eggs were good but the salad was incredible and likely the reason I felt a little gassy after this. either way, I was really satisfied, probably due to the fiber and protein from this meal. this tonkatsu Bento was easily 100 out of ten. this is my dream meal and this- along with a sushi rolls, you see- was only 15. Yes, you heard me right: only fifteen dollars. this egg and avocado sandwich with a biscuit was one of the simplest meals but yet one of the most satisfying meals, probably because it was one of the first meals after my long flight. but easily still an eight and a half out of ten. this Katja Pepe was the result of a nighttime craving and a 9 out of 10.. I cannot find a good Katra pepper in the States, but this was so creamy and no Lactaid was needed because- fun fact- the main ingredient of Cacho Pepe is hardage cheeses which has little snow: lactose."
oYWxNy7DNR4,"what I ate in a day in London for breakfast, diet eggs with sourdough, toast, sauteed spinach, roasted tomatoes, mushrooms and black Penny beans. this was such a good breakfast and the beans were the best beans I've had in my life. I always like to make sure I'm having a filling breakfast on vacation, since I've been walking around so much and I need to make sure I'm properly energized. for lunch I had my favorite meal of the whole trip at dishum, which was highly recommended to me, like a hundred times before I came. we got the chicken, Ruby, black doll, gun powder, potatoes, chili, broccoli, salad, chicken, biryani and naan. as I mentioned, this was the most delicious meal I've had in a long time and everything was so flavorful. addition pays homage to the Ronnie cafes and the food of Bombay. though I would usually have a snack, I was so full from lunch so I didn't eat again until dinner. for dinner I went to Golden Union and got the cotton chips with a side salad, because I'm in London and I need to try fish and chips. the cotton chips were so crispy and tasty and the salad was a salad. but hey, I have to stay regular somehow. overall, 10 out of 10 day. it's so important to enjoy the food you're eating, especially on vacation. it's also a great way to try new foods that you may not have much of back home."
IfTkrdu-Yfs,"everything I ate on my 11 hour flight to London. for dinner I had to choose between a chicken fajita or vegetable cottage pie, so I chose the chicken fajita and got this. this came with a small piece of bread and a brownie- the chicken feed. it was tasty, but the portion was really small. the bread was kind of dense, but I love bread, so I was still happy. after a few hours I whipped out my airplane stack pack, which is made of shelf, stable, high protein, high fiber snacks. I'll list everything here. this is really easy to eat and really satisfying. I worked for a few hours and an hour after finally falling asleep I was awoken for breakfast and don't get me wrong, it looked really good: Icelandic yogurt with breakfast biscuit and pastry- but, as you can tell, I was way too exhausted to film it. but I did eat it and it was fine. after 11 hours we finally landed in London. this is actually my first time here, so if anyone has any recommendations, please let me know."
fSf2ZEVS2wk,"I went to college more than 5 000 miles away from home. make dinner with me. they talk about how it changed the way I viewed food. just in case you're new here, I was born and raised in Hawaii, but I went to college in Boston and in case you haven't been to either of these places, they're Polar Opposites. I was definitely in a new environment with new people, a new schedule, new food and just any college student does. I missed home, and the closest thing I had to home in Boston was food, but there wasn't a lot of Hawaii food in Boston, so I had to make my own and since I Associated food with childhood memories, lessons I've learned and people I loved, it made me feel closer to home. now I'm nourishing my body. it made me feel connected to my roots and this is actually what started to make me feel proud of where I came from. now don't get me wrong: I grew to love Boston as a second home and I appreciate all the new experiences I had- people I met and food that I tried. oddly enough, being more than five thousand miles away from home made me appreciate home even more and I'm so grateful for that. today we have a baked chicken, Kata curry with rice and a salad with miso. let's eat so good."
rcOw_moqt2c,"it's time to meal prep my mason jar noodles. you might have already seen my first mason jar noodle video, but this time we're doing a miso broth. so start with miso paste- better than bouillon, vegetable base- and soy sauce, cabbage, shredded carrots, Tofu for protein, noodles and green onions. you can store these in the fridge for meal prep, but when you're ready to eat them, bring them to room temperature, pour in hot water, cover and Shake.

-jiJ8IzO17U,"i'm a dietitian and i used to absolutely hate food. make lunch with me, as i tell you why. i grew up as a really picky eater, like to the point where i didn't want to eat food. i had this intense fear of vomiting and ocd, which ended up manifesting into a full-blown eating disorder. there are multiple days where i had to leave class as a nine-year-old because i didn't have enough energy to make it throughout the day. what people don't understand is that food is one of the most vital components of our lives. not only does it fuel us and give us energy to make it throughout the day, but it's present everywhere, all the time, whether it's having lunch at school, eating dinner with family or going out to brunch with friends. and after you spend so long fighting food, you grow to hate it and fear anything related to it, and i ended up getting hospitalized and almost dying because of this fear. and then i saw a dietitian and they saved my life and relationship with food. it's not as though it happened overnight and that the process was easy, but here i am as a dietitian, making food i would have never eaten at the time and loving food more and more every day. while doing so we have summer rolls with cucumber, carrots, rice noodles and sesame tofu with a peanut sauce. let's eat, um so good."

pbXxMRAQvms,"I'm a dietitian and this is day two of realistic nutrition tips that you can actually start today. I'm about to tell you one of my biggest tips: focus on adding, not subtracting. instead of saying that bagels have carbs and that we should avoid them, let's ask ourselves: what can we ask them? we're missing protein, so let's add pesto eggs. protein is going to keep me full and it makes up hormones and many important enzymes. so now we're missing fibers, so let's add some arugula. fiber helps control blood sugar levels and can lower risk of certain Cancers and cardiovascular events. now let's make a meal tasty for ourselves. for me, I'm gonna add some cheese and hot sauce to bring it all together. as I've said before, we can still have carbs, but perhaps as part of a larger meal. that will help us stay energized and nourished."

UlVKpXOLtxg,"i'm a dietician and this is day one of realistic nutrition tips that you can actually start today. this tip was life-changing for me personally. i used to get the worst stomach aches and bloating when i was a kid, but it's because i eat too fast and finish my whole meal in like five minutes. if you want to slow down your eating paste because you find yourself inhaling food in short periods of time, place your fork and our food down between bites, just like this, and when you're done, go back for your next bite. it's that simple, but it makes a big difference. now that i've been doing it since i was younger, i take longer to eat, which gives my body time to digest and signal to my brain that i'm full."
awDtGXJsOUI,"this is part five to five things i would personally never do after working as a dietitian. let me know if you wanna hear more, because i have more of these. one, i would never tell people that they have to avoid canola oil. notice how people telling you to completely avoid it because it's inflammatory tend to have three things in common. one, they don't have credentials. two, they have no relevant formal education. and three, they have no professional training. whether or not you use canola oil to cook that delicious, balanced meal at home is not something you should be extremely concerned about. two, i would never tell someone that brown sugar is healthier than white sugar, because it's not. brown sugar is usually white sugar, but with molasses added back to it. three, i would never take a fat burning or metabolism boosting supplement, because none of them were. four, i would never take one of those dna tests that tells you which diet is supposed to be best for you, given your dna. you don't have the science to develop such personalized nutrition recommendations yet. five, i wouldn't tell someone that diet soda is way worse for them than regular soda, because it's not true. that myth is especially not helpful for people with diabetes, who could benefit from reducing added sugar intake if they're drinking a lot of regular soda. so choose whichever one fits your health goals."

8ygg9jrtVpg,"i'm a dietician and this is one of my biggest recommendations. blend your cottage cheese and make it into a high protein dip. add cottage cheese, garlic, chipotle pepper, cilantro and lime juice in a food processor or blender and blend. one cup of this chipotle cilantro line dip has 26 grams of protein. you get to have it with chips, bell peppers. it's the perfect balance snack."
JeU4M9Phzrs,"five things I'll never do after working as a dietitian. I have more of these, so just let me know if you want to hear more one: I will not be spending extra money on alkaline water. our bodies do a great job at regulating pH on its own. alkaline water will not help with this. two: I will not tell people that drinking coffee will dehydrate them. coffee does have a mild diuretic effect that can cause you to pee, but the fluid you're drinking when you're drinking coffee offsets this. three: I will not be listening to a majority of people on this app that claim they're gut health experts. all these girls are talking about gut health is, though, your stomach issues and gut health will improve if you do what they say: cut these Foods out, take this supplement, drink the smoothie. it doesn't work like that, and everyone's symptoms can be due to different causes, even if they have the same symptoms. four: I will not be avoiding microwave. a lot of people claim that microwaves zap the nutrients from food, but heating Foods up, even on the stove, can break nutrients down. microwaves are actually better at preserving some of these nutrients because cook time is shorter. five: I will not be drinking celery juice. it doesn't have all the crazy health benefits that people claim it does, and also I don't like the taste. if you want to drink it, that's fine."
Sog9EN6e2Rk,"this is part three of five things I would personally never do. after working as a dietitian, I have more of these, so just let me know if you want to hear more. one: I will not be avoiding MSG. Decades of research have found no link between Chinese restaurant syndrome and MSG, and the idea that MSG is a neurotoxin is false. two: I will never buy fresh fruits and vegetables. exclusively Frozen produce is just as not more nutritious than fresh, and they're much more affordable and accessible. three: I won't be avoiding soy. we actually have evidence to show that it reduces cancer risk. notice how prostate and breast cancer rates are lower in Asian countries, even though they consume much more soy than Americans. four: I won't be avoiding gluten because I don't have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. noodles and bread are my favorite, and I'm here to tell you that you're not making a healthier choice by avoiding them if you don't have to. five: I will not be avoiding a food just because I can't pronounce some of the ingredients on the nutrition label, because if I were to follow that logic, then I wouldn't be able to eat anything, even blueberries."
JcPB-Dp6erw,"this is part two to five things i would personally never do after working as a dietitian. as i said before, i have a lot of these, so let me know if you want to hear more. one: i wouldn't buy organic just because it's healthier, because it's not. the dirty dozen and clean 15 are not legit. two, i never take any nutrition and health documentary- like what the hell seriously. many of these documentaries are not credible because they cherry picked data. they're also very biased. three, i'm never choosing sweet potatoes over white potatoes because it's healthier, because it's not. they're both very nutritious. four, i'm not gonna buy sea salt or pink himalayan salt just because it's healthier than table salt, because it's not. there's no significant nutritional difference. i choose based off my cooking preferences. and five, i will not avoid gmos for health reasons. gmos are not inherently unhealthy and it's time we stop pushing that narrative."
wYi6NqCUUEk,"these are five things i personally never do after working as a dietitian. i have so many of these, so let me know if you want to hear more. one: i would never do a juice cleanse. no, it does not detox your body and no, it doesn't reset anything. two: i wouldn't pay for a food sensitivity test. keep in mind there's a big difference between a food allergy test and a food sensitivity test. one is evidence-based and one is a waste of money. three: i would never do prolonger any program that required me to fast for an extended period of time. it makes you feel horrible and it promotes unhealthy eating behaviors. it's basically an expensive way to starve yourself. four: i would not use a waist trainer. the results you're seeing are temporary. five: i would never buy a flat tummy to you or any tea that claims that i can make you lose weight, because they all do one thing and that's make you shade yourself, and that's just not on my bucket list personally."

zXfKuvuRRu8,"today i'm going to share with you what i tell people when they say they want to start eating healthier. you want to focus on adding, not subtracting, which means you want to focus on what you can add to your diet instead of what you want to take away. let's take this bowl of cereal. most people look at this and think i should really stop eating carbs. but instead of thinking of what to take away, let's ask ourselves: what are we missing? protein keeps us satiated, so we want to make sure we're having this with all of our meals. an easy and popular example would be milk, because it's a complete, high quality protein. that's why we feel fuller and satiated for longer when we have milk and cereal together. the second thing we want to add is fiber. since many breakfast cereals may not have a good source of fiber, let's add some fruits, crushed nuts and seeds. not only will fiber keep us fuller, but it can help control blood sugar levels, improve our gi health and lower cholesterol levels. nuts and seeds also provide healthy fats, which can also help keep you full and help with the absorption of vitamins a, d, e and k. notice how our bowl is no longer just cereal. we can still have our favorite carbs, but perhaps it's part of a larger meal that will help us stay energized and satiated."

VNd4Bx2MWK4,"if you have a perfectly normal poop every single day and have never had stomach issues, this video is not for you. okay, now that i'm a hot girl, stomach issues are here. let's make a super quick and easy ibs friendly dinner. as we all know, i have ibs and my dietitian, which makes for a pretty interesting combo. we're gonna put this in the oven at 400 degrees for 5-10 minutes. now we're going to wash and cook our rice. the washing is essential, not for ideas, but i might judge you if you don't. now let's make the most delicious salmon. that's not gonna kill you. we're gonna do white miso, soy sauce, rice vinegar, oh, and maple syrup. okay, now i'm gonna put you on something. if you can't eat garlic, like me, this is a great garlic replacement. i use it in everything. i'm just gonna add a little bit in and you're just gonna mix it. so now we're gonna coat our salmon and bake it in the oven for 15 minutes, and here is our final dish. so good, and the best part is that i won't feel horrific after, which is a win."
A2LLKqX8Phg,"i'm a dietitian and today we're going to have natto, which is fermented soybeans- a very healthy, traditional japanese dish. so you're going to want to mix it just like that. then you're just going to put the sauce on, mix it again. natto is high in protein, fiber, iron, vitamin k- literally so many things. oh, look at that, perfect. so i have my rice here and i'm just going to put it on top. you can put like green onion or like a raw egg on it, but i have neither of those things today, so let's try it."
O8YAE94zlws,"today i will be worsting my ibs to show you a super easy meal that you can make in under 10 minutes. i might be a dietician, but i'm just like you. sometimes i'm lazy and tired and sometimes i want to cry instead of cook. but today i will cook first and cry later, or maybe i'll do that now too. now, this is the only cooking i will be doing this meal. add some onions now. you're just gonna saute this for like five minutes. now you're gonna add your beans, some cumin, some oregano, some salt and some water. now just let it sit for a few minutes. now we have our easy brown rice, easy protein. for those who hate cooking chicken because they're scared of getting salmonella, let's try to get on some veggies here now. we love a healthy fat. it's okay, you can come out, it's good. we obviously need some cheese. i will be regretting this moment in exactly one hour from now, for just like a little just. and there you go: super easy meal in under 10 minutes. so good, so easy."
l1ZThDZrofw,"i'm a dietician and let's review what these doctors eat for lunch. looks great. it looks like she also has some greens on her plate, so very well balanced meal. it looks like she has more than just avocado and chicken on her plate, but i'd recommend adding a carbohydrate for more energy. this looks perfect for the winter weather, but i'd recommend adding a protein source such as red lentils. salmon is a great source of omega-3s, which can improve cardiovascular health, but add a carbs, such as rice. this seems to be a trend for darrow. if someone struggles preparing lunch, i usually recommend leaving food at work such as these. i'm starting to wonder if it's a requirement for everyone to have a nice lunch in order to work here, because everyone's food looks so good. looks great. love that she has some protein, a vegetable and a starchy vegetable. though i like simple salads, we still need more for this to be a substantial meal. maybe some quinoa or some protein like chicken or tuna."
fziHHReY4jM,"i'm elisa dietician and this is what i ate for dinner. first, to cut up some pizza crust and topped with pizza sauce and mozzarella. now add some veggies. i'm going to use yellow, orange and red bell peppers. i'm adding shredded chicken- in this case, leftover rotisserie chicken for protein, and topping with arugula for more veggies. pop it in the oven for 10 minutes at 400 degrees fahrenheit and drizzle with balsamic glaze. it's so good and comes together super quickly. 10 out of 10 would recommend."
RTmKGoOaiUo,"dietetics and becoming a dietitian was an eye-opening experience, especially as an asian person in a white dominated field. around 85 percent of dietitians identify as white and since all my professors were white, they weren't familiar with any foods besides the foods they knew, which were foods like kale, salad, chicken and quinoa, and in my training i was taught that these foods were healthy, whereas ethnic foods like the hawaiian and japanese foods i grew up with, were unhealthy. dietetics has struggled with underrepresentation for decades, which can be difficult for people of color who are not properly represented and therefore are told they can't fit their cultural foods into a healthy diet. for a long time, i had a hard time reconciling my own favorite foods like udon or lau lau with what it meant to eat a balanced diet, but then i realized that all foods fit, even my favorite cultural foods, and that i could enjoy them alongside foods like chicken and quinoa and kale and still be just as nourished. so if you're watching this, instead of avoiding your cultural foods altogether, include them, celebrate them and just know that all foods fit. i didn't know this sooner, which is why"
czEr4PiXAvA,"so i saw the viral trend of people grating eggs and avocado toast and at first i was a little disgusted, but then i was really intrigued. i just need to know if it's good. so first i'm just gonna spread a lot of avocado on my toes, now we're gonna grate the egg, now some salt pepper, now i'm gonna add some grated parmesan. i'm gonna add some hot sauce, but i have ibs, so not too much. all right, surprisingly good, no, excellent."
9kyeawQti6M,"me making myself soup every day after finding out how easy it is. so i'm a japanese dietitian and this is how i make miso soup: in five minutes by endashi and four cups of water and bring to a boil. once it's boiling, you're gonna want to reduce the heat. this is important because boiling miso can make it lose its flavor and nutrients. then strain three tablespoons of miso through a mesh strainer- i highly recommend this one- and you're gonna add your wakame soft tofu and green onion, and that's it. i will never get tired of how good this is."
XhxuutNo2Xw,"i'm a dietician and let's review what these doctors ate for lunch. i love a good soup, especially during the winter, and i like that. the soup has some protein and a lot of veggies. okay, whoever is having filet mignon for lunch is obviously doing something right with their life, but i'd add a starch like potatoes or whole wheat bread for more energy. these doctors have some nice meals. this looks great. broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable high in vitamin c, fiber and antioxidants. someone said that zero should take memory pills instead of supplements, and i completely agree. i encourage food before supplements and i would love to see daryl have some sort of meal. liliana's got a lot of fiber there, which is great, but i'd recommend adding some protein so she stays satiated throughout the day. okay, her meal looks colorful and delicious. quinoa has a whole grain that's high in protein, so love seeing the meals. this looks easy and delicious, but i'd recommend adding a veggie like green beans or bell peppers or whichever veggies you like."
a4o4XGOSGcI,"how do i eat healthy and lose weight? well, you want to eat fruit, but not too much, because fruit has a lot of sugar and sugar is bad for you. avoid carbs, because it's bad for you and raise blood sugar levels. but also carbs are your body's main source of energy. you have to eat every few hours, so boost your metabolism, but also try intermittent fasting and go 16 hours without eating to help you lose weight. going gluten-free will help reduce inflammation and help you lose weight. but also gluten is not inherently bad for you and there's no reason to avoid it if there's no medical reason to don't eat eggs because it raises your cholesterol. but also eggs are a great protein source and you should have it with breakfast. lastly, fat makes you gain weight, but keto, a high fat diet, will help you lose weight. does that make sense?"
8WREPQNfyq0,"if i told you you can eat this and still lose weight? most people get stressed around this time of the year because they're scared to gain weight, so they try different diets in order to lose weight. the most common thing i see people do to lose weight is to cut foods out. typically, that food is carbs. but what if i told you that you're focusing on the wrong thing? what if i told you to instead focus on adding foods you may not be getting enough of? there's a good chance you may not be eating enough protein or vegetables, and these foods are key to staying satisfied sometimes. we just need more balance in the diet rather than more restriction. you deserve to look forward to meals rather than stress whenever you feel an ounce of hunger. so next time you see one of these meals, hopefully you won't be too confused when i ask."
X7RWQeHHc6A,"i'm a lazy dietitian and this is what i ate for dinner. [Music]. this is your sign: to get over your fear of tofu and to cook it in a pan. add in frozen veggies, add in frozen fried rice. you can use any fried rice, but i highly recommend using this one because it adds so much flavor. and that's it. that's the whole meal. we love an easy meal because"

lXYzt1q3hFs,"these are the best and worst asian trader joe's products. part two: i love mochi ice cream and these are actually great, especially the strawberry. the crispy crunchy mochi rice nuggets are tasty and satisfying and i find it weird that no one ever talks about them. the philly cheesestick bowl buns are a choice, not a good one, but there was definitely a phase in college where i ate the veggie spring rolls way too often. they're especially good air fried, and don't waste your time on the beefa."
2M1Rzp2sR48,"this is what a lazy dietitian eats for lunch. first get your bread- i use sourdough- and spread some trader joe's green goddess dressing on one side. add turkey slices- i like black pepper, some avocado, greens, pepper and drizzle with balsamic glaze. this meal has protein, veggies and a healthy fat. it takes a minute to put together and it tastes so good."
lyQ__en_zoM,"these are the best and worst asian trader joe's products. the steamed chicken soup dumplings are fantastic. 10 out of 10 lives up to the hype. soy sauce is one of the worst soy sauces i've ever had. would not recommend. the japanese fried rice is unexpectedly good. definitely worth a try. the orange chicken is not authentic but it tastes great and is awesome when air fried. i could literally eat multiple bags of roast seaweed a day. it's cheaper here than other health food stores, but not as cheap as asian stores. the gyoza is surprisingly good."
wCuI5OrjhGI,"welcome to another realistic non-diet. what aena day as a dietitian started with my soy milk latte, of course. then I made some oatmeal with some protein powder in there, added some peanut butter for healthy fats, lots of berries, some hemp Parts on top. it is so satiating and so yummy- love it. for lunch I did a Sourdough sandwich with some pesto, lots of avocado for healthy fats, egg chicken, put some cheese on there. we loaded it up. it was a big sandwich and I served that with hummus, some carrots and some strawberries. poppy enjoyed it too. for dinner we ordered in. I had a vegan udon noodle soup and some edamami. I'm obsessed with that a mommy, I ate the whole thing. it's so good. and for a bedtime snack I dove into the Lays family siiz bag of ketchup chips with some cottage cheese, cereal and fruit. yum."
e-xHZopzuUk,"things people have yelled at me for on the internet as a dietician. number one: saying that seed oils aren't complete poison. number two: eating unhealthy food or really anything that's not green juice, salad or avocado toast folks. having an occasional pizza night doesn't mean I have a junk diet. number three, saying that you probably need more than 1,200 calories a day. for the vast majority of women, young or older, 1,200 calories is nowhere near enough. number four: if I even so much as hint at the fact that it's possible for a larger body folk to be metabolically healthy, one of my goals on this app is to really invite everyone to reexamine their biases on that. and finally, when I say that diets usually don't work, I talk about why weight loss is so hard, to encourage dieters to exercise some self empathy and to demonstrate some of the key factors in what may lead to weight regain, not to dismiss people's desire to lose weight."
LFrT3oEW02w,"apparently this one original Crispy Cream dut has nearly 100 ingredients. they also have Valentine's donuts for the day of love. it would be very loving to give your loved one a donut that has nearly 300 ingredients. and there's 25 g of sugar in just one doughnut. calling this 300 ingredients is pure fearmongering, since a lot of those ingredients are repeats because each component of the doughnut is being listed separately. so, for example, we see sugar listed here and here and here and here and here and well in a lot of places, because it's in the dut and it's in the frosting and it's in the filling, Etc. I'm not saying this is a simple ingredient list that I would recommend for daily consumption, but for the most part, people at least know that a Valentine's Day Crispy Cream doughnut is not the most nutritious everyday breakfast. it's something that, when enjoyed on occasion as a fun food though, is not going to break your health. so I really think that harping on the ingredients and sugar content on a specialty doughnut is a bit of a Captain Obvious moment, and as nutrition communicators, we have way bigger fish to fry next."
FaGnvfxTPPA,"this is the most important piece of advice I can give. hey, everyone, I'm Abby sharp, I'm a registered dietician and there is a lot of shady, extreme, hyper restrictive weight loss advice floating around right now: skip this meal, cut out these Foods, drink this tonic, Etc. that I'm all about a non-restrictive, additive approach to food, even when you're trying to lose weight. so my top tip is to add more protein to every meal or snack. protein needs are particularly High when in a calorie deficit, with research suggesting that increasing the percentage of calories from protein from 15 to 30% resulted in eating 400 calories less and losing three times as much fat, because we can utilize about3 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per meal or snack for muscle protein synthesis. one of the most important habits you can get into today is prioritize protein at every meal, ideally around 20 to 35 grams per sitting. adding protein helps provide longer lasting, stable satiety, energy and blood sugar levels and increases the chances of weight loss success without scarcity or restriction. this could look like adding a serving of chicken or tofu to meals and a scoop of protein powder or a bowl of Greek yogurt at snacks. add, don't restrict, and make sure to hit that follow button for more no BS nutrition advice."
an8UREDhAFA,"okay. so I just bought a brand new ninja creamy Deluxe, because my first one blew up. so let's make protein ice cream.

2y8ZmEMOhVg,"love me a wedding, a day that doesn't start with a full-on body check. okay, so those eggs look amazing and I love that. we've got protein, fat and, depending on what type of bread, at least we're getting a little fiber in there too. all right, looks kind of like we're making a salad here. we've got lots of crunchy lettuce and cucumber. we got protein in our deli turkey, healthy fats and fiber in the avocado and hummus, so yummy, spread on some flatbread. we love it. for dinner, we got lots of and healthy fats in our salmon. looks like we're making kind of like a peel off situation with the rice spinach for some extra fiber and antioxidants. so simple and, I'm sure, super sa shating. and dessert: there's something so satisfying about a cup of hot chocolate with whipped cream, especially in the dead of winter, and those little cookie things- oh my gosh, they look amazing. this day is Super nutritious, balanced, non-restrictive and inspiring, to say the least, and now I'm craving a little Whi cream next."
85PSwShkqiE,"so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to take our donut pakas and our nectarin and we're going to cut them in half now for your jelly filling. what we're going to do is we're going to take the jelly from one of your figs, we're going to scrape it out and then we're going to put it in the middle of the dut so it tastes like raspberry jam, sh together to make your jelly donut, just like this. okay, no, immediately. no, like there's nothing wrong with people calling recipes something cute because it looks like something else. like zucchini noodles because they look like noodles, or protein ice cream because it has the consistency of ice cream, like whatever. it's all semantics, right, these foods are just really fun ways of serving everyday food, but they're not a replacement for the real deal. so like, no, Christina, a peach cut in half with fig guts in the middle is not a replacement for a donut. peaches are delicious, don't get me wrong, but they're not jelly donuts. next,"

And when one of my followers asked what is a gold body, the troll replied: one that's 20 lb lighter than hers. she has zero muscle mass as well. to be clear, if I were to lose 20 lbs on my naturally slim frame, I would be officially very underweight by BMI standards. I definitely wouldn't have more muscle mass, which tells me that I would need to be physically sick and now nourished for people on the internet like that to respect my evidence-based content. this is what is wrong with Wellness culture on social media. the lay person is more interested in following the advice of someone with zero credentials, zero education, as long as they are a size zero and aren't much more than 100 pound, but also with ample muscle mass. so yeah, that nails down the candidate pool really fast. folks, my body is not my business card, and I love the body that I have, and I love this part even more, and I really hope that one day you can find that same inner peace and, more importantly, stop embarrassing yourself online. it's not cute. next,"

eZWzSz2okXc,"I love omad and I don't no, but I'm glad this is working for Gabby. but as a dietitian, I'm not a fan of the omad diet and I'm going to tell you why. it is next to impossible to get all of your micro and macro needs into one meal. when you're losing weight, specifically, and you're in a calorie deficit, protein needs are particularly High to prevent muscle wasting. so, generally speaking, we're recommending about 20 to 30% of calories from protein, or around 1.8 g of protein per kilogram of body weight, to give you some rough numbers. for a 200 lb person, that is over 150 g of protein. you would have to eat like 25 o of steak in one sitting and even if you managed to pack that in, most of the protein would not be used for muscle protein synthesis. we want to space our protein into 20 to 35 G doses, or more specifically, 4 G per kilogram per meal every 3 to 4 hours. by eating only one meal a day, you might be losing weight, but there's a really good chance. a chunk of that weight would be metabolic muscle and it is very, very hard to get that back. so yeah, I'm going to pass on the omad diet next."
9ZU8GgDRQpA,"this is wild. Kelly rea's trainer just revealed exactly what Kelly eats in a day and, honestly, I am shook. what has shook me to my core is that this diet is literally identical to what she posted on Harper's Bazar in 2020. that I responded to way back then in her Harper's bizarre food Diaries, which got purposefully scrubbed from the internet due to backlash. by the way, she stated- you were to ask me this. one year from now, I will have three entirely different meals, but it will be the same rotation of meals for just about a year. as I discussed on my video right here. Kelly's team actually reached out to me asking me to remove the video that I posted, because they claimed that this diet- recall that she did- was not an accurate representation of her real diet. it was a cleanse day- apparently a cleans day that now we see was actually her diet for over 3 years. so here's hoping that Kelly's PR team makes light of this article too, because, yeah, nobody needs to take these tips to Heart. next,"

nm6HKabxdBw,"[Music]. all the millennial women who have been burned by D culture are like in the comments, calling out their favorite Bagel orders. because we grew up in a time when eating a bagel was equivalent to like screwing around with your high school best friend's boyfriend. it was the ultimate betrayal. it was a sin. we were told to hollow them out and like feed the innards to the birds. we were told to eat those thin ones, which are not Bagels, by the way, they're just like thinly sliced bread with Hol in the middle. we were told to put cream cheese on bell peppers instead and like: shut our eyes and lie to ourselves that we enjoyed it. abuse, we have been abused. so yeah, now that we're on the other side, we got a bagle in one hand- we're like flipping die culture the bird on the other.

I loaded it up with the guac and salsa. poppy was obviously a huge fan- she always is- and for dinner I had a family favorite, which was pizza chicken breast with some roasted bell pepper, cauliflower and rice, and then I did some caj cheese with some whipped cream and sprinkles for dessert and a couple of these super delicious tiny brown butter cookies. oh my God, they're so good."

I always have a good selection of pasta, and then that one is squash pasta. I like to drink B bath almost like a tea. this one is delicious, I love this- and regeneratively sourced blueberry bat last bar, and it's made with cashews, dates, sunflower butter, sweet potato and spinach.

Jd3Z9F1sqjo,"as a dietician, I never drink or eat fat-free Dairy, and since you asked, I'm going to tell you why. so it is true that most official nutrition guidelines still recommend low or no fat Dairy. we're now learning that higher fat Dairy contains unique fatty acids like butyrate, and other beneficial compounds like conjugated linolic acid, vitamin D and gangliosides that may offer some protective effects that we miss out on when we go skim. we also know that dairy fat may help deffer the insulin response that may be seen with lower, no fat Dairy, specifically for folks with insulin resistance, PCOS and diabetes. one 2019 systematic review found that most sources of full fat Dairy, particularly fermented dairy, did not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. consuming full fat Dairy has also been shown to reduce the risk of being overweight or obese by 8%, and for women specifically, emerging research has linked full fat Dairy to reduce risk of in ovulatory infertility, whereas low or non-fat Dairy actually increased the risk, and other research has found that fat-free Dairy is more likely to increase the risk of acne than full fat. most importantly for me is that it is delicious and satiating, which helps to reduce our need to fill the gaps with refined carbs. m"
YoinrR3DsUM,"every morning my mom drinks this 900 calorie drink. that I think is absolutely absurd. so she grinds up some almonds and pumpkin seeds because she says chewing it just too much work, so she just grinds it all up and then she adds in some olive oil. a lot of cre do this, where they add in raw olive oil for the healthy fats along with some hem seeds protein powder. she really likes this brand because it's just purely almond protein powder and some milk and that is her concoction. we got loads of healthy fats and fiber in the nuts seeds, hemp hearts and olive oil plus protein in the protein powder milk and like everything else I just listed. like this is a Super Hunger crushing combo if I've ever seen M. but because she doesn't like the taste of super healthy things, she likes to have a chaser with it. today it was her pickle dcon Rish with some carrots and some good old EG rolls. and you're probably wondering: why does she put herself through this misery? it's because she doesn't want to eat this healthy thing all day, she just wants it in one go. I mean, if choking down a goblet of flavorless Health porridge with a chaser of egg rolls works for Mom, amazing, I'm not going to mess with a system that works. but she could also turn this into like a super tasty smoothie by just adding like a banana and some berries. or she could cook the hemp and the nuts and the seeds with the milk into a porridge and then add in the protein, put some fruit in there for flavor and some sweetness. that said, it's healthy as and if Mom is doing this daily, she probably has a good long life ahead. so definitely Abby approved."
fOn9OPilmRU,"since when are rice cakes healthier than oats? now, don't get me wrong. this looks like it could be really good, I mean especially for you were to use one of those like caramel rice cakes, yes, please. but nutrition wise I would take oats any day. a/2 cup of oats contains 4 gam of fiber, 5 gam of protein and 140 calories. in contrast, the two rice cakes that he used to this recipe does have fewer calories- probably between 70- 100 depending on the brand and variety- but it has zero fiber and only 2 gram of protein. so they might be lower in calories, but they're going to have a much lower impact on satiety and a greater impact on blood sugars, not to mention rice based products do contain arsenic. so while there is little to no risk in enjoying rice products in moderation- like I love me a little crunchy rice cake- I would just be mindful if you're having these overnight rice cake oats things every day plus other rice based products in your diet, never a bad idea to switch things up next."
XGxm0Kp0PjM,"if you're trying to lose weight, this is one of the simplest and most important things you can do. one of the most evidence-based ways to support your weight loss without extreme restriction is to eat a high protein breakfast. protein is King in the satiety hierarchy and the Apex of my Hunger cushion combo. research has consistently shown that protein at breakfast helps reduce our hunger hormone grin, increase our fullness hormones like peptide YY and glp1- aka the hormone that's manipulated by drugs like OIC- and that these hormones are affected not just at that meal time but throughout the entire day day, even in the brain. on MRI scans we see that a high protein breakfast reduces the brain signals that control food motivation and reward-driven behavior. the result is that we eat fewer calories over the course of the day, creating a natural deficit, even without any intentional calorie cuts. that doesn't mean you don't eat carbs, but it means that making sure you have a solid 20 to 35 GR in that morning meal can help to set you up for the day. so, whether it's eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, scrambled tofu or protein shakes, make starting your day with protein your number one goal."
FxqlFmnKvWE,"does chewing gum release the same appetite suppressing chemical in weight loss drugs like OIC? you know I was hesitant to respond to this question because I think it has the potential to encourage very disordered behaviors. but you guys ask me about this a lot and I don't believe in censoring science. so quick little trigger warning, let's talk about it early. small studies suggest that, yes, chewing gum can help to stimulate glp1 in the gut, which is responsible for the appetite reduction scene on drugs like OIC. it was also shown in another study where fullness levels were significantly greater and hunger levels were lower in the gum chewing group than the control. now, this was a super small study, but it is consistent with other studies on gum chewing and Cravings, plus more robust research suggesting that the slower we eat and the more we thoroughly chew our food, the more satiated we are from the meal. that said, the difference in perceived hunger when chewing gum versus eating nothing at all is only like a 5 to 20% difference. so this study is not suggesting that chewing a stick of gum will fill you up like you're still going to be hungry because you've eaten nothing at all. please do not take this research as an invitation to like chew gum all day instead of actually eat next."
dZDWrgb49sw,"more unpopular nutrition truths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know. emergency is not going to cure your cold if you're chronically skimping on sleep. a fruit smoothie may be less satiating than the equivalent amount of whole fruit, but it doesn't mean that it's bad. eating 8 lbs of raw food a day is not evidence of food Freedom. you're more likely to get sick from stressing over every ingredient in your food than you are from the food grade Kagan in a Costco chicken. suggesting fruit juice is as bad as soda is like equating zinc consumption with lead. raw milk is not easier on the gut than pasture. if anything, it's going to do a number on the old gut when it causes foodborn illness. which of these nutrition truths is going to make the most Wellness influencers mad?"

I added lots of different kinds of cereal, some fruit, some hemp Parts. it is so damn good and stating. for lunch I made chicken quesadillas and served it with some basic bagged salad- keeping it super simple and easy on a workday- and for dinner with stir fry I had some grown turkey, lots of veggies, some rice in there, some for a khaki on top and some cashews, and then we served it with some steamed buns. and for bedtime snack I had a bowl of my favorite pink himalay and sea salt lesser evil popcorn. it's so deliciously good and salty.

3Mku_mAllBY,"more unpopular nutrition truths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know. living off of salt and vinegar chips during pregnancy is far less dangerous for baby's Health than not being able to eat much at all. if sugar and food dyes encourage your sick kid to take their meds, they're more of a superfood than blueberries and peas. a high protein diet does not damage your kidneys. it is physically very, very hard to overdose on chicken. weight loss isn't primarily about blood sugar or insulin spikes. it will always come down to a calorie deficit. most intermittent fasters eating from 12:00 till 6:00 aren't even reaping the benefits they'd get if they had breakfast and skipped dinner. insulin isn't inherently bad for your health. it's actually imperative for muscle growth and repair. cutting out too many foods out of fear that it may cause bloating may actually be the true cause of your bloating. which of these nutrition truths are going to make the most Wellness influencers mad?"

yMMUN-Zeje0,"restrictive nearest resolutions are typically a recipe for Burnout. so focusing on what we can add to our routine, like the right supplements, is a much more sustainable approach and since our gut health affects every other system in our body, focusing on prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics can be key. if that sounds like the same word rice, let me break it down: probiotics are the good gut bacteria, prebiotics are the food that feed the bacteria and postbiotics are the beneficial byproducts from the bacteria digesting their fuel. I love rituals 3in1 symbiotic, because you get a full gut supporting routine in one capsule including two of the most clinically studied probiotic strains. it's shell stable so it's super easy to travel with. they're big on ingredient traceability and they utilize a delayed release capsule designed to ensure that the probiotics make it to the colon to do their job. so if you're looking to support your gut health this holiday, check out the link in my description for 40% off of your order."

I'm sorry, did we just call that beef gravel? never have I ever been tempted to eat a food described as the same substance on my driveway. now you can make better versions of stuff you love, like this meat cereal right here. meat cereal, no. I don't know if dried out beef with milk brings you Joy- amazing, you do you. but as a dietitian, this ancestral carnivore diet honestly freaks me the out. not only is making cereal out of beef about as environmentally unsustainable of a diet as they come, but this low fiber, highs saturated fat dietary pattern is about as scientifically backwards as it gets. if you must make beef flour, fine, but not in lie of plants. next,"
J3n9_wTuVyg,"if you're trying to lose weight, is hunger inevitable? the sensation of hunger is not necessarily an accurate measure of a calorie deficit. for some people, hunger can be an indication that your body is asking for more fuel than you are giving it, but other times our hunger cues can be misaligned with our body's true needs. so, for example, when you've underslept, your hunger hormones increase and your satiety hormones decrease. when we're stressed, our cortisol levels climb and we suddenly get cravings for high calorie food, even if this does not align with our physiological needs. another thing to consider is what you are eating to lose weight. if you're used to eating 2500 calories of Highly processed foods that spike your blood sugar and make you hungry again soon after, there is a good chance that you will feel just as full, if not more so, on a 2,000 calorie diet of protein, fiber and healthy fats. this is why I created my Hunger crushing combo, because when you add these satting compounds to your diet, you naturally Edge out the foods that Supply only small bursts of energy, resulting in Greater satiety for fewer calories."

TKc0upYf7xs,"people who eat hard-boiled eggs for weight loss. it works. you know why? because you're literally nauseous for the entire rest of the day. basically, # EG is the idea that eggs suddenly and unexpectedly start to taste like too eggy when you overeat them. but I think the reason that this is such a phenomenon right now in 20123 is that a lot of people got into eating eggs during the pandemic. we were working from home and avocado toast was all the rage and we had a lot more time to cook a breakfast at home instead of just like grabbing a latte and bagel on our way to the office. so we are eating a lot more eggs. so I would say that the primary reason for a lot of people's egg ick is just sensory fatigue, and this can easily be mitigated by mixing up your protein sources or switching up how you prepare your eggs and, if we're lucky, after a little cool off period, the eggi will go away. hope that helps folks get cracken."

I'll take like three of these as well and I'm no longer shedding water. okay, lots of questions here about not getting water. so kimchi and sauerkraut are sources of probiotics, like the lactobacillus strains, which having shown to help with IBS. when it comes to diarrhea specifically, one meta-analysis found that the consumption of fermented foods like kimchi, like sauerkraut, significantly reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea. as for ginger, we've long used ginger for diarrhea dominant IBS, but a 2020 animal study found that Ginger capsules reduced intestinal hypersensitivity of ibsd by inhibiting pro-inflammatory response and, like fermented foods, Ginger's risk profile is incredibly low. so I think both of these tips are really great. so congrats, Jackson, on the better poops."

I got so dizzy I collapsed. why, why? why she describes feeling so hungry, dizzy, collapsing and having blue balls for food when she goes grocery shopping, assumingly referring to the obsessive thoughts that she was having about food while not being able to eat. yes, we know that there are likely benefits to water fasts up to 72 hours, so most of the data we do have on said benefits are either in rats or our trans get in short-term. but it's very hard to measure the long-term benefits against the risks and cost of doing something like this, even if there were a ton of benefits. I think that chronicling this miserable Journey without medical supervision, insinuating like a no pain, no gain attitude in front of potentially millions of vulnerable young eyeballs, is irresponsible at best and super, super dangerous at worst."

I'm sorry the 90s cold and it wants its fat-free diet plan back. nut consumption is actually consistently not linked with weight gain. in fact, research suggests that those who consumed two or more portions of nuts per week had 31 percent lower risk of weight gain. and even in studies when nuts were added to the diet and total calories were not controlled, nut consumption still didn't lead to weight gain. so this is so old school that it hurts. being super fit and slim really just came down to no soda, no fried chicken and no nuts. sure, I guess it really would be super easy. but let's chat again when you've done some homework on socioeconomic factors, hormones, sleep, stress, scarcity, mentality, compensatory mechanisms and reward system dysfunctions and honestly, be careful who you call stupid, because fat phobias not a cute look."

I totally can see why Liz's kind of Keto carnivore style diet has reduced her GI symptoms. it's because she's cut out a lot of potentially triggering foods. but elimination diets like the controversial gaps diets that she references in the description, are not meant to be followed long term. you're supposed to eliminate and then reintroduce most of the foods that you cut out in a stepwise manner so as Not to cause long-term harm to the microbiome."

I just do not understand the concept of cooking perfectly good vegetables in carcinogens. you might as well start smoking again. don't you guys know that they inject burger patties with antibiotics and hormones before they even get to the store? the government probably adds in a vaccine there so they can control us. don't you know that the best part of the watermelon is the Rind, totally sugar-free and keto friendly, or, Christy? do you really need the carbs here?

wPA1IJ3i4kM,"people are calling it Nature's ozempic. I've got, I've gone and over a thousand type 2 diabetes patients found that, when compared to Lifestyle modification or a placebo, berberine did reduce blood sugar and blood lipids. it wasn't necessarily better than oral medications like metformin on its own, but when they were combined there was a significant Improvement. as for weight loss, one larger view of the literature found that berberine moderately but significantly did reduce weight and waist circumference. so there's no denying that in the world of supplements berberine is pretty powerful stuff. but I still would never liken it to the current All-Star anti-obesity agents like ozempic. if an influencer is trying to convince you that you can get the same exact results from an herb as you can from a powerful pharmaceutical, it's probably a really big red flag. next,"
XwqE_tT1FKI,"a lot of people ask me what I look for in a supplement and to me it comes down to three main things: quality, transparency and third party testing. rituals, multivitamin checks- all the boxes. they're all about delivering exactly what you need in highly bioavailable forms rather than like a hundred ingredients in non-clinical dosages. I use their Essentials for women 18 plus, but I also use their prenatal and post needle when I was in baby mode. but I am super, super picky when it comes to supplements and I like that. rituals backed by a visible supply chain with rigorous third-party testing for heavy metals, microbes and allergens, and they share in-depth details on their ingredients and why they're used. so if you want to try out ritual yourself, you can get 20 off of your first month using my code, a sharp 20, or go to ritualcom a sharp20. let me know what you guys think."
AQsTHlXVHBQ,"we're back with more unpopular nutrition myths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know. eating sugar isn't the cause of diabetes. it's a little more complicated than that. alkaline water doesn't change your body's pH. if it did, Wellness influencers would die. intermittent fasting isn't Magic. it largely works because you just skip a meal. there's the difference between legitimate bloating and just not having a flat stomach. the latter's something that we don't need to fix. organic cookies are still cookies. how they're grown doesn't necessarily make them a health food. drinking coffee on an empty stomach bursting in the morning won't spike your cortisol and make you suddenly gain belly fat. gluten-free isn't better if you're not Celiac or intolerant. in fact, most gluten-free products are less nutritious than their gluten-filled counterparts. honey and maple syrup aren't much healthier than table sugar. higher in some micronutrients, sure, but please don't aim to get your antioxidants from sugar. which of these nutrition myths are going to rile at the influencers the most?"
MeIsxC0NGxk,"do you want an honest yet unpopular piece of nutrition advice? celery juice only detoxes you because it gives you the runs. first of all, celery juice is like 98 water, and water makes you pee, and peeing is one of our body's natural detoxing mechanisms, so just want to clear that part out there. and second, if it speeds things up any faster than regular water, it's because it's so high in fodmaps that you'll be spending the morning painting the toilet like a Jackson Pollock and she not pretty, and I mean like there are less aggressive ways to do your business. for most healthy people, getting enough fiber, water and moving your body is all that is needed to support your body's natural detoxing mechanisms, which is ironic because celery juice is devoid of fiber. and listen, if you like the taste of celery juice, great you do you, but it's not the magical Elixir that it's being claimed to be. next,"
iB-QUPtK7sY,"more on popular nutrition truths that Wellness influencers don't want you to know about. eating 3 500 calories less will not make you perfectly lose a pound a week. BMI is intermittent. fasting isn't Magic, it's just a calorie deficit. six-pack abs are not healthy for most women. celery juice just makes you pee and poop. it's not a heavy metal detox. you won't get cancer from drinking a diet coke. you can't fully replace vegetables with ag1. bone broth won't single-handedly fix your gut. what other unpopular nutrition treats did I miss?"
HJjJKjqrpoY,"correct order is vegetables first, proteins and fats second and starches and sugars last. here are my quick and dirty thought. research does suggest that meal component order can have a significant effect on blood sugar, though admittedly most of the research- like this study- has been done on folks with diabetes. the study that's often quoted, which is likely the basis for Jesse's argument, found that doing veggies then protein and carbs, or Protein Plus veg then carbs, resulted in lower glucose levels than having carbs first, and I assume that this is where Jesse got her magic formula. this could mean having a salad as a starter and then going on to have your meat and potatoes make sense, but what about a mixed meal like a sandwich or a burger, or even this beautiful, Bountiful salad? thankfully, we see a huge benefit on blood sugar since satiety by simply combining these Foods. Ella, my Hunger crush and combo when parsing them out is inconvenient or nonsensical. this study found, for example, that having protein with potatoes or protein before potatoes both had significant improvements in blood glucose, and when we look at how similar these lines are on the graph, the difference to me does not seem like a big deal. certainly not a big enough deal to have your croutons all by themselves, or to eat the lettuce off your burger and then have the bun last."

I once ate a bad oyster and I was on the toilet for three days. it was great. I lost three pounds. Kelsey pictures, just just hide your body behind mine. they only need to see your face. it's fine. anti-blow pills: is there a food option that's vegan, gluten-free, dairy free, keto, organic?

If you experience three or more of these very debilitating symptoms, believe it or not, you're probably totally normal. yay, yay, influencers from the stop these pretty vague symptoms to prove that there's something wrong with you. and then, of course, you need some kind of supplement that they're selling to try to fix it. the reality is, sometimes you feel bloated because you ate a lot of cabbage. course, these symptoms can be linked to something more Sinister, so I'm not dismissing that there are clinical conditions that can be linked to these experiences, but for the most part, people on this app don't have a damn clue about your unique medical history, and listing off a bunch of random symptoms to try to sell you a program or a product is unprofessional and predatory, if it's even coming from a professional. at the end of the day, if it seems oversimplified, without context or vague, it's probably BS."

I'm gonna pop this into the microwave for four minutes until it's softened and deliciously golden. to top it off, we got some full fat Greek yogurt, some toasted pecans and a couple apple chips. all right, let's recap: we got lots of fiber in our apples plus our apple chips, healthy fats and the pecans, and lots of protein in our Greek yogurt, and it literally took a few minutes to make nature's candy."

What would a dietitian do with these? oh, you are going to love my apple pie bites. let's do it. okay, these could not be simpler. so they start with graham crackers, and I'm actually obsessed with graham crackers. I know they're called a cracker, but they're kind of like a cookie cracker. they're super sweet. they've got a nice little hint of sweetness, but not too aggressively sweet, and they're actually naturally low in sugar- just two grams per square. so separate those out and I'm going to take a big dollop of some Greek yogurt, a little chopped Apple, a little sprinkle of cinnamon and pecan for crunch. we got protein in the Greek yogurt, fiber in our apples and healthy fats in our pecans- all in a really delicious, fun little bite."

ESzxDSPGJs8,"as a dietitian, these are the foods I never keep in the house. okay, so you probably were expecting me to say chips and cookies and ice cream, but since healing my relationship with food, I've really found that I've been able to keep these Foods in the house and largely forget about them. so what do I never buy? pretty much just things that my family and I don't like. number one: kale chips. like why eat your kale and have your chips? like I always find that they're just so dry and I kind of feel like I'm gonna choke when I eat them. number two: low calorie ice cream. like hell to the no, no, no. honestly, it just tastes like air and sadness to me. I go with the OG and three energy drinks. those are like a big No-No for me because I have anxiety and insomnia. I don't need like 200 plus milligrams of caffeine in one go, so I'm gonna stick with my usual latte. if you guys are working on your relationship with food, I know it can feel really hard to keep some of these trigger foods in your house, but hit that follow if you want to learn how."

eJQXR9a2K7o,"meal prep with me while we unpack some drama. I feel like we need to acknowledge part of like the origin story, which is the gross fat shaming that Selena endured when she posted this picture right here. first of all, Selena looks gorgeous. she is a queen. but, in case people don't realize, Selena suffers from an autoimmune disorder, so if she does not take her medication, she could die. it's pretty serious stuff. typically, the medication prescribed for a lot of different autoimmune disorders are steroids. steroids typically cause weight gain, sometimes a lot of weight gain- all of which is uncontrollable. and I see bullying from adult women who a lot of young, impressionable viewers truly admire. I think how many young girls are gonna die because they refuse to take their medication out of fear of being teased, bullied and fat shamed like ladies? you have so much power, so much influence, so much responsibility in this world. don't it up."
t-B5BvPyIPI,"as a dietitian, this is the one superfood I cannot live without. gotcha, superfoods are built, let's get that straight. there are no foods that have magical powers in isolation, and nutrition is more than just the sum of its parts. so to me, a superfood is a food that makes you feel physically and emotionally super. my superfood, naturally, is coffee. it's part of the comforting morning ritual for me. it emotionally actually makes me feel great, and it has a ton of antioxidants that have legitimate health benefits."

h9FMGlhgQnk,"as a dietitian, these are the three healthy foods I refuse to buy right now. number one: lettuce. there's a reason why so many restaurants are dropping salads on their menu right now: it is expensive as. so, while I love my salads, I'm probably going to be sticking to stir-fried and roasted veg. number two: berries. I love berries, but I live in Canada and we haven't seen a local Berry in like six months, so they're either coming from like California or Mexico and they kind of taste like, so I'm gonna be sticking to Frozen and try to focus on things like apples and pears. and finally, kale. I just don't like it. like unless I'm drowning it in Caesar Dressing, the bacon bits and croutons. I'm not that jazzed about it. sue me, you know what I always say: healthy food is only healthy if you actually eat it, and Hill is more likely to sit in my fridge and wait. what healthy foods are you avoiding right now? leave me a comment below."
23xICsLrU9w,"as a dietitian, I never buy these anymore, and I'm going to tell you why. honestly, because it's just like the vegan ones better. as you guys know, I'm not vegan, but there are some key vegan products that I just legitimately enjoy more than the G, and veggie hot dogs are one of them. not only do these taste and smell basically just like a regular hot dog, but they actually have eight grams of protein each, plus are packed with iron zinc. I'll never say no to the OG if someone offers it to me it's like a barbecue, but when I have the choice, I will always go for the veggie dog."

erpp6W3zRbs,"this is the biggest mistake I see people make when starting a new diet. I'm a registered dietitian and I see so many people plan to start a new diet on Monday or on January 1st after New Year's, and they spend the entire weekend beforehand binge eating all of the Forbidden foods that they have left in the house, you know, to get them out of the house before diet starts tomorrow. we call this the last supper effect and it's such a common Pitfall in dieting circles that often keeps folks trapped in a vicious binge restrict cycle. they were strict too hard. they binge, they say it. I might as well eat all the things now and start my diet again on Monday. rinse and repeat. if you're falling into this habit, it's good evidence that you're probably restricting too hard. try to allow yourself some of these forbidden Foods throughout the week so you don't feel the need to cram everything in before they're completely off the table. let me know in the comments below if you've ever experienced the Last Supper effect and how you overcame it."

q-1_pebYteQ,"gluten-free foods have definitely earned a bit of a health halo over the past few years. but are they actually healthier for you? well, like most things in nutrition, it kind of depends. if your Celiac or gluten intolerant, then of course it makes sense to go gluten-free. but gluten-free products tend to be more refined and lower in fiber than their gluten-filled counterparts. so if you can tolerate gluten, I say go with the OG."

rluZlPqC01A,"if you're feeling under the weather, stop what you're doing right now, because I'm going to show you a super effective and delicious and easy chicken soup. there's a reason: your mom always made chicken soup. when you're sick. there's actually some evidence that it may help with congestion, a sore throat and, of course, hydration. but when I'm sick, I don't have the energy to be making a really hearty broth from scratch and cooking the chicken from scratch. so I got a few shortcuts to make this happen. step one: order rotisserie chicken and take the chicken off the bones. step two: get a box of bone broth for some extra protein and flavor. step three: throw the chicken bones into the soup- huh. step four: add some root veggies. add in our chicken. chicken soup is packed with protein, selenium, zinc and vitamin C, which is really important for helping to support our immune system. it's also water packed and we know hydration is so important when we're battling a cold or flu. hope you guys feel better."

I love adding chopped Apple to Cranberry sauce, even if you're going to make a homemade, because cranberries are so tart. there's a lot of added sugar here and the Apple helps to stretch out that Sugar by adding lots of natural sweetness, not to mention. I think it gives it a nice texture. plus, it adds lots of fiber as well.

NOoRKkgQ7pU,"happy. what holiday pie does a dietitian pick? um, um, the one you like the most, and I like pumpkin or more fat. but it's the holidays and if you're intentionally choosing a pie that is healthier for its slight nutritional Edge, you're gonna have major food fomo, and food fomo, AKA fumo.

0NskB9pdPcE,"so, as a dietitian, how do you like to make your eggs? anyway, all the ways. but if I had to pick a single way to do eggs, this is what I do most often. off three Rich eggs. my little hack is I add in a little bit of cottage cheese. cottage cheese is like packed with protein. there's 14 grams of protein and a half cup, so it's a great way to just like bulk up the protein even more. a little salt, a little pepper, and we gotta obviously double down on the cheese Factor so that they've got lots of really yummy cheesy flavor. Brody, are you ketchup? are you hot sauce? definitely hot sauce, but I do love ketchup as well. well, I got this like Curry ketchup, so it's like spicy and it's like a ketchup kind of Base. it is next level good. so that's what we're using today. cannot wait to dive in. what do you mean? oh yeah."
FL_PA8RXlWA,"cause you're just a man. honestly, is any kind of milk sacred these days? okay, folks, let's go over this one quick. oats contained carbohydrates bound up with fiber, which slows down its blood sugar response and also improves it's satiety profile. oat milk will have lower amounts of that fiber, so in that sense it's going to create a greater blood sugar response than Whole Food oats. but that doesn't mean that it's pure sugar, nor is it horrifically bad for you. it actually does have small amounts of fiber, protein and a ton of other essential nutrients, and it's a great option if you have food intolerances or allergies to things like nuts, Dairy and soy, and it tastes great. so, for goodness sakes, can we stop trying to find fault with every food? oh,"

fIYwl6TGo6Q,"my PMS slash birthday Edition, but I mean bikes are healthy today because if I know I'm getting my period soon, I really make sure I'm healthy to avoid any period cramps. we just want to be cautious about putting too much stock into eating very healthy or, in her case, actually identifying as a very healthy person, which can be a bit of a slippery slope into disordered eating behaviors like orthorexia. second, can you eat your way out of period cramps? we know that Ultra processed foods are typically higher in salt and saturated fats, the former of which can increase feelings of water attention, while the ladder can increase prostaglandin production, which may increase the severity of cramps. if you also find yourself constipated thanks to the extra progesterone leading up to ant flow, boosting your fiber and water intake can also help to move things along. if this helps you get through shark week, then by all means."

I'll get the um, the nuts and the brown sugar, please, and the latte. wonderful, thank you. okay, so normally I'm a whole egg kind of girl, but the egg white bites at Starbucks they just hit different. I don't know what it is, the, the texture it's just like a little cloud, and I also just find that the bacon ones are a little bit like too salty for me. I don't eat a ton of the sugar, just maybe like a couple teaspoons just to sweeten and adding in some healthy fats with our nuts. this little Starbucks meal here, 32 grams of protein and five grams of fiber, so I feel like it's a pretty good start to the day. good crunch."

Tick Tock said that I have to eat the vegetables first, to meet second and then the bread if I want to manage my blood sugars. research suggests that there are significant benefits to eating your carbs less. we're largely done in folks with diabetes, and the one that was done with healthy participants had eight subjects. oh so it's all. it's actionable. it just totally over complicates things. we do know that there are benefits to dressing up naked carbs by pairing them with a source of fiber, protein and healthy fats, aka the hunger crushing combo. and if it makes sense in the context of a specific meal to like have your veggies first, like a salad, for example, then I think that there is some benefit to that. but stressing over deconstructing your sandwich or meticulously making sure that you're eating a piece of broccoli or chicken before a piece of pasta in a casserole seems like it's missing the forest from the trees."
uRGvL7HczNY,"make sure everyone sees the ingredients. bad guys, there's sunflower oil in this. why do I debate of Wellness culture? it actually makes me mad folks stop producing Foods down to a single ingredient. yes, oat milk contains some sunflower oil to improve the mouth feel. there's actually a few different types of sunflower oil, some of which are higher in monounsaturated fats and others higher in polyunsaturated fats, and, looking at this label, I'm seeing more monounsaturated fats and omega-6s. So nutritionally speaking, I think this is a pretty nice looking product that I also happen to know tastes really great. so just a little Pro tip here: folks buy what you like and if an ingredient doesn't work for you, no problem, choose something else. but can we stop with the elitist food shaming? it is really not a cute look. next,"
C-pdpyF3lrw,"hey everyone. i'm abby sharp. i'm a registered dietitian and this is what i eat. in a day when i'm super tired, af coffee is essential. i did an iced soy latte. i had a greek yogurt parfait with chocolate chips, banana and granola, plus a kind of gross looking smoothie that's actually really nutrient dense. for lunch i had a chicken greek salad and this kogaman, which was absolutely out of this world. dinner was turkey sausage, asparagus and fries. then i had cottage cheese parfait and some aussie bites."
veh98fUAzdU,"this is gonna be a hot take and i know i'm gonna get a lot for it, but this is something that i have to call out. mayonnaise is gross, as i'm kind of weird about my mayonnaise situation, where i'm fine with it if it's already on a sandwich. if it comes on a burger, if it's a fancy aioli from a fancy restaurant, i am down. but there is no chance in hell you're ever gonna find me reaching into a mayo container, scooping out that gloppy, sloppy mess with the. it makes that sound, can't handle it, and putting it on my own sandwich. i can eat it, i can taste it, i can smell it, but i cannot interact with it. leave me a comment below if you agree."
WNHTQnrcG5c,"i'm a dietitian and this is what i eat in a day: coffee always. then i mix some protein powder into my cereal with berries, plus a slice of sourdough with cream cheese and figs. lunch was quesadillas with some salad and guac plus a little greek yogurt parfait. went out for dinner and had some pizza and pasta with chicken and finished with a handful of chocolate chips and nuts."
Gd5nnK_2geE,"I am so glad I'm done dieting and can enjoy cereal again. samies, I see you got some Pebbles there, personal fave of mine. I'll pour you aable. oh, no thanks, rain check. brand flakes, nuts, berries in a protein shake- that's a diet food. it's nutrient-dense, but that doesn't mean it's diey. I've got a super busy morning and I want to feel alert and energized. this will help me do that a bit more. but this tastes better and you said it was your favorite. shouldn't you eat what you want? honoring Cravings in your taste buds is important. it's not the only thing to consider. nutrition knowledge can play a role too. it just doesn't dictate your choices like it did when you were dieting, seems diety. no food is diety or not diety. viewing food in that way might signal that you've still got a lingering diet mindset, except now, instead of following diet culture, you're just trying to do the opposite. diet culture is still in charge. W. having no food rules is a brand new way of viewing nutrition, away from diet culture, without obsessing or stressing."
9OJdx53KlF4,"the kitchen is officially closed. anyone got a lock pad? what's uh going on here? I've been really good today and I'm not about to let a stupid laps and willpower ruin it been there. let me explain something to you about willpower. what so? willpower is basically just mental energy, our ability to make decisions that allow us to feel our best. but the thing is it's not an unlimited resource, meaning it's easier to make more Feelgood decisions earlier in the day. when we have more mental energy. this we make more and more decisions. that mental energy tank goes down. if we've had an especially exhausting day, by the end it gets tanked, yeah. hence the thing is that sign is drawing you to the fridge. what we say we can't have, we want more. what do I do? a, make sure that you're fueling your body adequately during the day. then, B, see what you can do to avoid total mental depletion. maybe plan some self-care Tas at night. I like my idea. it's easier, might feel easier in the moment, not inevitably after you binge."
Fuz3gq27phk,"snack time. samies, have you tried this combo? it's delicious, no thanks. I'm trying to avoid any high carb foods. um, what the carrots? they have carbs and sugar- hard stop. yes, they do have carbs and they naturally contain sugar, but I wouldn't call them a carb per se. what do you mean? you just said they had carbs. well, firstly, carbs aren't bad. secondly, just because something contains a carbohydrate doesn't mean it's a significant source of carbs. to put this in perspective, You' need to eat 46 carats a day to give your body the recommended amount of carbohydrates that it needs. I think you'd turn orange and be really sick of carrots. yeah, no, I'm going stick to keto. it's really working for me. just wait until you let yourself have a handful of granola and then you end up inhaling three bags in a matter of minutes because your body is in dire need of a carb. speaking from experience, I have something called willpower. I'll be fine. hate to break it to you, but you can't out willpower. biology, girly pop."
GcyujZasFpI,"she calls it Berry cheesecake fluff. okay, so it's not the most creative name, but this creamy, dreamy pile of goodness is delicious. it is the perfect sweet snack. let me show you how to make it. get yourself a big old mixing bowl and add vanilla Greek yogurt to it, followed by cheesecake instant pudding mix. then blend that baby up. next, you're going to add whipped cream. fold it in. fold it in, not stir, otherwise it'll get soupy. then add frozen berries. these will thaw and thicken it up as it chills in the fridge. eat it with a spoon or scoop it up with a gram [Music] cracker or a bit of both. the choice is yours. but give it a try. you're going to love it."

IJhzy0qK0WA,"I wish I wasn't so restrictive and can just let myself eat. I mean, look how confidently Katie polishes off her food. what is wrong with me? I've been a not so proud member of The Clean Plate Club since the '90s. how come I can't just stop eating halfway through like Julie? is the rest of this rap actually screaming my name, or is it just me? but I've reached my point limit. so wait, maybe I should be doing keto and just use slices of cheese for a tortilla. I wish eating were as easy for me as it is for Britney. you think there's any seed oils in here? I've never been a big Dieter, but after following babore XOXO, I feel like I'm just super confused about nutrition. like WTF am I supposed to eat? maybe that's why Ashley's only eating veggies. everything else is poison."
gDwH1qIwL2g,"okay, Burger tacos are the best because they can fit so many toppings and this special sauce. it's the best. and the tortillas get a little Crispy Crunchy. that's what's up. let me show you how to make them. first, make the sauce by combining Mayo, ketchup, mustard, sweet relish and some pickle juice. then take ground beef and add ketchup wor your sauce, garlic powder, onion powder and salt. mix that up real good. then you're going to take it and add it on top of your tortilla in one even layer, press it down and then cook for a few minutes on each side. add cheese if you like. Burger as a taco greater than burger with a bun. hell yeah, give it a try, you won't go back. [Music]."
YZsW4c-TNy4,"I have got to lose some weight. why do you say that? because I don't feel good. I just got to set a goal weight and be real good at working towards that. okay, the not feeling good part is valid, but I really wouldn't advise setting a goal weight. why I need something to work towards? well, because setting a likely arbitrary goal weight isn't the same as finding your body's best weight, the one where your body feels best at mentally and physically and functions optimally. not to mention, working in such a weight focused way is likely to lead to weight gain in the long run. so how do I know what my best weight is? I'll explain everything in a free 1hour training. we'll go over the facts and myths about weight and a three-step process for finding your best one without a dreadful diet that's just going to backfire. where do I sign up?

I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I'm worried that'll happen to me. Ashley stop dieting and girlfriend doesn't look any different. will my body just stay the same too? I want to stop dieting, but I can't say I'm not nervous about what might happen to my weight."
dJqq6offTQk,"we're gonna talk about weit. what am I waiting for? no, we're gonna talk about wait. I am waiting, but would you hurry it up? no, I'm going to talk about the topic of weight gain, loss, maintenance. you're supposed to be in the Nonet space- I am- but weight is the topic on everyone's mind thanks to our thin obsessed Society. it's natural to have questions and concerns as a result. I just really think we shouldn't talk about weight. I agree, weight shouldn't be such the talked about topic and instead we should shift our Focus to our behaviors and how we feel. but people have questions and if the only people who are willing to talk about weight are the ones who are in diet culture, then that's who people will turn to and the wheels of diet culture just keep turning. instead, what if there was a safe place to talk about the science and the facts about weight from a non-diet lens? wouldn't that help? so many finally say to to diet culture? I don't know, I'm going do it next week. you can join if you like."

Mickey D only sells these in Canada so I had to make my own. nailed it. here's how I made it. first, we got to make the zesty lime sauce with mayo, lime juice, cilantro and garlic, mix it up and spread a nice heaping of it onto a tortilla and top it with chicken, tomatoes, cucumbers, Red Onion, some crushed tortilla chips for a little crunchy Crunch, and then mixed greens. then add the rest of your sauce. this is truly the perfect lunch: flavorful, fueling and freaking easy. give it a try. the tortilla chips are what's up."

kNCUbzIKcRQ,"I would gain like 10 lb from eating a single cookie. I used to feel that way too, but the reality is your body doesn't really change after eating a single cookie, even though we physically feel like it does. it's kind of a messed up mind trick that diet culture plays on us called embodiment. what now, embodiment is when we take something like a feeling and we turn it into something more tangible, something we can touch or fix. or do we take what's going on in our minds and we put it on our bodies? what the heck does it have to do with me eating a cookie? we feel that way because of the feelings of guilt and shame. it can feel so much more tangible to fix a body. we're used to doing that with dieting rather than to address our emotions. so you're saying that I'm putting my guilty feelings onto my body. I need to work on eating the cookie without feeling guilty? yes, exactly, or maybe I just need more willpower to not eat the cookie in the first place. problem solved- wait, that's no."
vGGJggHyh5A,"protein bars that actually taste good and help keep me feeling full. I've been eating These Bars from Costco for years. they're some of the most affordable ones. belt bars are a totally different vibe. they're much more chewy. I like them chilled in the fridge. bear balls are a newer one, but they are fabulous. they have a really nouy texture. Quest crispy bars are great for a fruity Vibe. I randomly stumbled upon them in a hotel lobby."
GkaPIM_p790,"I cannot believe you actually made these. can't fathom why I wouldn't, because you're literally taking carbs and shoving fat and sugar into them and it is delicious. don't come crying to me when your body is full of inflammation, hormonal disregulation, blood sugar imbalances, dire need of a detox cleanse. eating something more Soul nourishing than nutrient doesn't mean I'm going to become unhealthy. being able to enjoy fun Foods is part of living life. being healthy is more important than having fun, or you could just have both. research shows that allowing yourself to enjoy the fun foods, and doing so without guilt, leads to an overall more balanced, higher quality diet. eating that is helping your health. being more flexible and guilt-free is helping me be healthier overall. but most people can't eat those things in moderation like you, thanks to diet culture. but they can learn. I'll teach you. oh gee, I got to run. maybe another time. someone's a little bit flaky, and in the good way."
uTbUYacD2yE,"this is cookie dough and this is cottage cheese. they're both delicious, but they are not the same, so let's stop pretending like they are. I just bought this, so let me show you how I made this. first up, take some cottage cheese and you're going to blend it till it's nice and Whippy and smooth. then you're going to take a big old bowl and mix your Blended cottage cheese with oat flour, protein powder, vanilla, maple syrup and mix it all up, then fold on in your chocolatey chippies, grab a spoon and get eaten. it is actually very tasty. both of these can have their time and place. sure, might be more nutrient-dense, but that doesn't make the other bad or morally wrong. it's about finding a feel-good balance between the two. give this a try. if you want a nourishing, snacky snack, oh yeah. or don't. if you want and stick to this, it's up to you. also delicious, it's the spot."
h8Q196jdezI,"check it out. I made my own high protein peanut butter eggs. oh, that's a fun little snack. I snagged one at the store. that's the difference between you and me. I care about my health. it's totally okay if you prefer simple ingredients and even adding a protein boost, but let's not go spreading false information. the kind of funny looking names on the ingredient lists are safe to consume. most people are getting plenty of protein from other sources. it's that kind of thinking that's making us all sick. if everyone just ate clean and stopped eating so freaking much, we wouldn't have such a Health crisis. or is it the extremist thinking and our society's obsession with being thin that is actually rebounding and causing more health issues and weight gain? you're one of those people, huh, don't diet Donuts all day. no, I'm one of those. don't diet. learn to care about your food choices without obsessing or stressing kind of girlies same thing, it's actually not. you might benefit from learning about a more balanced approach to not dieting than just the donut clickbait you see online. follow me and I'll show you."

5oMfXenFHDg,"breakfast time. huh, wait, are those waffles? yeah, I had a hankering, so I bought a box of Frozen ones. you can have a couple if you want. isn't that kind of a lot of carbs you got going on? oh wait, are those the specialty low carb keto ones? no, they're just the regular all Frozen ones. I like the whole wheat ones for a little extra feel, full fiber and whole grain boost. that doesn't look like a very healthy, balanced breakfast. actually it is. I added some Greek yogurt for a punch of protein, peanut butter for fat, and then I mixed some Frozen berries with maple syrup, warmed it up in the microwave for a little bit of a micronutrient boost and to boost satisfaction. I think we have different ideas of what's considered healthy. I used to follow a ton of healthy food rules too, but turns out they weren't as healthy as I thought. now, no food rules. my definition of healthy is waffly different. awfully, awfully little food pun. no, are you sure you don't want to bite? not eating enough carbs can make a gal really cranky. might help you."

Mel Health babore XOXO says it is like the best volum meting hack. I've been having it all week. for sure it's delicious, but I'm not sure I'd follow that volume eaing advice. you said you were hungry right like starved today, so annoying. well, if you eat a ton of low calorie, high volume foods like watermelon, your stomach is going to be full, no doubt, but you probably won't be satisfied. you can fill your stomach to the GM, but if you're not giving your body what it needs like calories, carbs, fat and protein, you're probably just going to end up in the pantry 20 minutes later, elbow deep in the jar in Nutella. nuh-uh, that happened to you yesterday, didn't it shut up? I call it like I see it."
EPsKHtIQ3aU,"how to evaluate a protein bar. the source of protein can differ. some people's tummies tend to feel better with certain kinds. exactly how much protein? there is no legal definition for what counts as a protein bar. by learning to view nutrition labels neutrally can be helpful to evaluate it for yourself. many protein bars also contain fiber. helps us feel full and satisfied for longer periods of time. eating a protein bar high in fiber could lead to indigestion. different types of bars Also may use different fiber sources. some people react differently. a variety of sweeteners are usually used for some. artificial sweeteners can cause tummy upset, but they're usually totally fine from a health and a nutrition perspective. if you prefer more Whole Food Source bars, that's okay, but you do not need to fear consuming a protein bar that is more processed. it may be helpful to zoom out and peek at the total calories. some may be more fit for a lighter snack and some for a more filling one. do some experimenting and have some fun with the process."

I mean, it's been a busy day, or maybe you're just sick of these boring work tasks need a boost of feel-good dopamine? yes and yes. okay, so maybe we just step away for a minute. maybe we get out into the sunshine or watch a funny YouTube video or, if you want, you can snuggle with this guy. then reassess how you feel. and if you still want the food, okay, I'll give it a shot. did you have peanut butter for breakfast by chance?

FotAC3HpXwE,"um, those are not muffins, those are cakes. way too many carbs for the morning. o, I love these. they may not give as long lasting energy as, say, a bowl of oatmeal, but we can still enjoy them. um, peanut butter with added oil and sugar. never would I ever that is so bad for you. the added oil keeps it from separating and the sugar adds a touch of sweetness. if I prefer this kind, or it better fits my budget, that's okay. how are they even selling this junk that's filled with toxic artificial coloring? these were my fave as a kid. the amounts of additives in our food are regulated to Safe amounts. I can serve and eat these guilt-free. I hope everyone who's taking a sample is logging that into their calorie tracker, but I bet they aren't. ooh, I've been wanting to try this. don't mind if I do. oh, mhm, totally worth the hype. do they know how many calories are in that pizza? so unhealthy, give yourself a death sentence. why don't you look at that cute fam having a pizza lunch date?

I'll actually eat way more. I may or may not eat the whole thing, like you're assuming. okay, Miss, I have the superpower of self-control. not everyone can just listen to their body. you're right. most people can't just start listening to their bodies thanks to diet culture hacks stealing their ability to listen to them. but it's not a superpower that I have. I've just put in the work to relearn how to listen to my body regardless. you can't deny this has way more nutrition. I'm not, but you still want to eat this? yep, that's just so irresponsible. you should really care about your nutrition. maybe you need to care a little bit less. having a healthy balance is sustainable, enjoyable and supports our well-being. you should try it now. give me those cookies."
aP4VfnU7Vv0,"protein bars can be a great tool in your nourishment toolbx. like pretty much all things, they do have pros and cons. dieting behaviors and restrictive eating can take many forms, like having a chocolate protein bar instead of a brownie when you're craving it. you also likely shouldn't use a protein bar as a meal replacement. this is even true when they're marketed as meal replacements. protein bars can support your health and fitness goals when used appropriately, but they are not intended to serve as a complete dietary substitute. so in reaching for that protein bar, ensure that it's for the right reasons."

I prepped a whole batch so lunch was super easy to put together. also had leftover veggies and this delicious seasoning. this salted Margarita bar satisfied my sweet tooth, needed something on the go and I switched up my usual. I had a bear Bell's protein bar- delicious, chewy and not at all chalky. dinner was butter chicken sauce with some chicken and mushrooms that I paired it with white rice and some broccoli that I needed to use Cookie Dough Bites satisfied my desire for a little susum."
Ojy0BXC89dg,"only eating junk food is not necessarily a right of passage for your intuitive eating Journey. it's not wrong or bad, but often times people think that only eating these types of foods is how you become an intuitive eater and eventually it'll all just click. not always true. there's more to it than that. one of my biggest tips is tuning into your hunger and fullness cues before jumping right into breaking all of your food rules and stocking your house. otherwise, of course, we won't know how to stop eating those Foods. what happens if you say yeah, yeah, Colleen, that would have been great to know, but I already started eating all of the things. not to worry, we're going to slow down. think about the foods that you want to eat, but also how different foods make you feel. do not feel guilty or wrong or ashamed. if you feel like you're in this place of only wanting to eat junk food, you're not alone. you're definitely not a lost cause."

I would have thought everyone would have just switched to Splenda by now. problem solved. yeah, no, we also aren't afraid of eating real sugar. that bananas- well, only half one, am I right wrong? well, I wish I could stay, but I've got to run.

I'm not going on vacation, lady. a similar thing can happen when we stop dieting. we're like woohoo, eat all the things, no guilt, feel in control, all great things, but we focus on the there instead of how to get there. so what do I do? well, you need to clearly plan and Define your steps to get there, to be able to eat in a way that feels good. then your weight will fall into place.

I'm just obsessed with these. lately afternoon, Sweet Tooth equals more donut. allow me to introduce you to single serve bloody mary Devil's eggs- so good. I scooped some up with some crackers to make it a little more filling. dinner was, very randomly, Arby's copycat beef and cheese sandwiches is very delicious and I served it with some Co sloth, which your girly loves. and that's a full day with no food rules."
RgW_cjr5BjM,"let's do this. what are you doing? this mental toughness challenge? it's not a diet culture diet about how you look. it's about overhauling your life. you've got to be disciplined. if you screw up even just one day, you got to start over. I totally understand the desire to want to have a goal and to want to do hard things. it does feel satisfying. but I'm not sure this is the best idea. and why not? well, studies show that actually not being so hard on yourself and having self compassion is positively associated with diet quality, meaning you eat healthier. meanwhile, shame and guilt are associated with increased disordered eating Tendencies, including binge eating. but I need structure. if I just free ball my Wellness, I won't be well. structure isn't bad, it can be super helpful. but Extreme All or Nothing thinking, not so much. that's just being weak, that's just being rude. is this mental toughness or mental? I'm just going to be a jerkness. I'm not go eat with Tina."

It's Not Butter, oh heck. no. keto is life. oh, sweetie, don't forget to drink your glass of milk with dinner. hey, sweetie, can you hand me the grass-fed, wild caught oat milk for our smoothies? a moment on the lips, a Lifetime on the hips. it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle."
adIR4_gCdqE,"check out my bun hun. oh, in mood for a little handheld salad, are we? well, this allows me to eat the fries too. there's nothing wrong with enjoying a crisp lettuce wrapped burger if that's what you're wanting, but you can eat a bun and Fries I no. no. two carbs in a meal, that is just too much. it's not too much when you listen to your body and eat the amount. that feels good. yeah, but I can't do that. I just eat all of everything that's on my plate. then I'd be in a carb coma. this is healthier. low carb. livon just takes a little thought and planning. M. it might feel that way right now, but eventually all that mental gymnastics adds up and it eventually takes up, like all of your brain space, making life way harder, not easier. being unhealthy makes life harder. all that's stressing about food is going to be worse for your health, and not to mention the increased binge eating tendencies that come along with placing limits on food. but suit yourself. I fried to tell you."
dCzl7tDl5Yk,"fear of weight gain is a learned behavior due to unrealistic standards of beauty. our standards are ever shrinking. it's been seen in the Miss America Pageant contestants over the years, with a steady decline in BMI. we can unlearn it: assess what you believe is true. many times when you see someone in a larger body in a TV show, they were portrayed as the funny fat friends, not often the successful love interest. these connotations have been ingrained in us, but that doesn't make them true. shift your goals from being weight focused to well-being focused. if weight gain were to occur, it's because your body needs it. our bodies are smart cookies and are sort of looking for their goldilux: weight isn't too low or isn't too high, one that feels comfy and is easy to maintain within a range."

jFszgVqBibA,"oh man, well, good Morning, Starshine morning. where's the coffee? it's over there and there's some creamer in the fridge. if you want some, add extra calories and sugar to it? I don't think so. don't we still drink this black? why do you even have that in your house? because sometimes I find creamer in my coffee delicious and satisfying. we're not afraid to drink calories anymore. want me to make you an omelette? I make them pretty good, yeah, but can you just use egg whites and then load it with a bunch of veggies? why does yours have whole eggs and cheese, did I? I miss the memo on a cheat day or something. yeah, we don't do cheat days anymore either. those are kind of just planned binges and we now realize the Yol is a nutrient Powerhouse. plus the fat in there is needed for our bodies to actually absorb some of the nutrients from veggies. I knew the future would be weird, but this is just bananas. speaking of bananas, wait till you hear we now make smoothies with full ones, not just half. it's like I don't even know. you trust me, it's a good thing. we've come a long way."
ntBWhkt4C0M,"oh yes, come on, I think this is what heaven tastes like. prepare a box brownie mix according to package of directions and put it in an 8 by8 pan. in a separate Bowl you're going to combine softened cream cheese, sugar, vanilla extract and one egg. you have two options for the raspberry sauce. you can either use jam and lemon juice or you can make your own with raspberries and sugar. you'll mix some of this with your cream cheese mixture and then make a nice layer on top of your brownie batter. get fancy pants and make a swirl. just dollop some sauce on top, connect the dots, add raspberries if you like. bake according to the B. I'm not going to say you need these, but I'm not going to say you don't, it's so good. I left out a very key ingredient: guilt m."
yp9L2YHX3rQ,"Susan is totally crushing her workouts. you see how much weight she's lost. remember how we talked about not commenting on someone's weight? yeah, but it's okay because she's truly doing it for her health. she likes the workouts and she's not doing any cray cray dieting stuff. I'm so glad for that. but I still don't recommend focusing on weight or her physical appearance to keep her motivated appearance. focused exercise is related to less perseverance or wanting to do set exercise, so what you're saying is her hard work should go unnoticed. my gosh, no, I'm not saying that at all. I'm just saying what if we helped her create internal motivation for her new routines by saying things like, wow, you have so much energy, or your mood is Lively and chipper, or wao, that box was really heavy way to go, girlfriend, you picked that up with ease. that's just silly. everyone loves to look good. it'll motivate her, trust me. what's silly is focusing so much on how our bodies are looking instead of how they're actually living."
GyyO_utJd0M,man. her butt looks so much better in leggings. mine looks all lumpy and jiggly H these compression shape or leggings are giving me a huge gas bubble. they're so tight. hope no one just saw me pick my wedgie. I wish my body was as toned as hers. she's like all muscle. I really hope losing my period because my super low body fat doesn't impact my ability to have children. dang that girl lifts heavy. I look so dumb with my tiny baby weights. I feel so manly for lifting heavy. maybe I should take up Pilates. that's way cuter and more feminine. everyone else stays for way longer than me. front desk lady is probably juding me: only 2 hours and 55 minutes left in my shift. I wish I could be as confident as everyone else and have a normal relationship with exercise 2.
bn07VwwBT74,"just lose a little weight and you'll be fine. Healthcare systems are historically and notoriously riddled with diet culture. do a bit of research on different providers. go online, ask friends or family members for recommendations to go to or maybe even to avoid. set super clear boundaries before your visit. I recommend both calling and emailing to really get your point across. might seem like Overkill, but a lot of times it's needed. when you arrive, remind them of your desire for or non-diet care right off the bat. ask to not be weighed. a weight-based medication may be necessary and a weight is medically needed, but many times it's not. if you receive negative comments about weight or suggestions for weight loss, ask to reframe their recommendations into a weight neutral perspective. don't hesitate to reach out to this community for any support or guidance that you might need and giving your body and well-being the respect and appreciation you so deserve."
ppWxoUAOWL4,"no, no, no, girlfriend. hey, get that back. powdered peanut butter is so much better for you. I used that stuff in place of real peanut butter for years and let me tell you what these two are- not equal swaps. don't hate on my choice. first, right back at you, and second, I'm not hating on it, I'm just saying they're not the same nutritionally or satisfaction. wise duh. this gives you way better nutrition, not necessarily. the powdered stuff is more protein dense, which could be a plus, but a con could be that there's not much fat in there which our bodies need to feel full and satisfied and to function properly. I see the powdered stuff as a way to add a protein boost and maybe a little bit of a Nutty flavor, and this stuff is a way to add more nutrient density and essential fats and to satisfy an actual peanut butter craving. we've got the bread for the carb, Greek yogurt for some protein, and then we've got the peanut butter on top for a little bit of fat. you mean you're going to get fat. your fat phobia is a whole other topic we got to discuss."
Xsm2RzGhfVQ,"check out my 17 ID omelette, wo I heard protein is super important at breakfast. so B Appetit, and that's totally true. protein helps keep us full, satisfied and gives us nice, stable energy throughout the day- fabulous. but our bodies need more than just protein. okay, says the girl eating a stack of carbs. take your own advice, will you here? I'll go make you one. oh no, need these Kodiak waffles have a sneak attack protein punch, all while being so delicious, and not to mention, I could probably make this meal like 10 times over. in the time it would take you to make me an omelette. all I've got to do is pop them in the toaster and dress them up. I like to load them up with some yogurt, berries and peanut butter. yum, mine is yummy too. yeah, doesn't look all rubbery at all. I'll just leave these extra boxes of Kodiak waffles, power cakes and oatmeal right here for you, just in case you're hungry again in, uh, 20 minutes. that's what I thought."

xD5HTgHrxWs,"time for breakfast. what you making. I'm embracing a life of no food rules. this is the sixth day in a row I've had this. so glad you're ready to give up dieting. you have full permission to eat this. but I got to ask: are you enjoying this? does it feel good? sure, it feels good to eat all the sugariest things I've been depriving myself of, No Doubt. but eating intuitively, with no food rules, isn't just about always picking the sugariest food available. it's about fueling your, your body, in a way that feels good both mentally and physically. well, I haven't pooped in 4 days and my midm morning sugar crash is pretty bad. I think you might have a skewed, extremist view of the idea of intuitive eating and food Freedom. you're in the place that I like to call not dieting. you're rebelling against diet culture, but you're not yet fully eating intuitively. so it's okay if I go make myself a smoothie. I think I'm going to be sick if I take another bite. that's an intuitive choice. we're getting somewhere."
kOi7lLkqtqo,"what if you can't deny the fact that you like the way that movement makes your body look? is it okay to like it when your body has a bit more muscle definition or is a bit more lean? one question you can ask yourself is: would I still do these types of movement if there was no chance that they'd change the way that my body looks? let's say that you're a Pilates girly and love the way that your tushy looks when you're consistent. you also do genuinely love going to the classes. it relieves stress, the people are great and it feels good to your body as well. would would you still want to go to the class if you didn't have that Pilates booty to show for it? what we are looking for here is to not have your motivation for movement be dependent on the way that your body may or may not look. as a result, studies show that appearance focused exercising motivations stem from how you look- is not great source of motivation long term. separating your reasons for exercising from this is key."
mEO2-xL-dB0,"these honey mustard pretzels. chicken bites are about to become a new favorite. they're so easy to make. all you do is make a super simple honey mustard dressing to start. you can also use a store about version. if you prefer our short on time or just don't feel like it, coat your chicken with some flour, set it aside. then we're going to take our pretzels, add our spices, mix it all up, then take one egg and whisk it with some of the honey mustard dressing. now give those chicken bites a swim in the egg wash, then coat them in the Crispy Crunchy pretzels. you have two options for cooking these. you can either do it in the air fryer or bake them in the oven. they come out super tender and juicy on the inside- the perfect protein addition to any meal."
6HuFBv9Uc2E,"here's everything I ate this week, with no food rules. dinner edition. Sunday was pizza soup, which I made for the first time and was delicious. Monday we had what I call warm salad kit and I made it with textured vegetable protein. it is literally just that: warm up the veggies with some oil in a pan, use the toppings, add some rice and a protein. you're good to go. Tuesday was what I call fancy spaghetti. take ground meat, add some mushroom sauce and a couple scoops of cotage cheese. it gets super creamy and delicious. add your pasta. I also served it with spaghetti squash on the side. MVPs of Wednesday are soyaki sauce and these pre-cooked noodles. just add a stir fry frozen veggie, sauté up some chicken with some oil, add that stuff in there. literally just mix it all together. Thursday we had warm salad kit again, but a different flavor and I used turkey guys. this is a go-to in my house. it's easy and delicious by Friday and burnt out. so frozen salmon burgers. it is tap with lemon, D Mayo, tomato and I just served it again with a side salad. my husband's obsessed with this one. Saturday was date night, so we started with some kind of sweet potato appetizer and then I had a very delicious buckwheat chicken, creamy Rosemary, I don't know pasta. I had a happy tummy and that's a full week with no food rules."
gmU3pfjReWE,"clutch twinsies, I'm making a wrap too. did you use the low carb ones? so clutch? no, mine's just a regular old wheat. one girl, you got to try these. they're way less calories. yeah, they are, which is actually why I chose this one. my body and most people's bodies need more energy than that, specifically from carbs at meal time. but have you seen the amount of fiber that's in here that helps keep me full? oh for sure they do pack a serious punch and that can be great. I just be a bit careful of how many of those you consume. it's like half a day in one shot might give you bowels some troubles if you're not used to it. my wheat one has less, but still a decent feel full Boost and the extra fiber in there won't make up for the lack of calories. your body needs enough energy no matter how much fiber is added, otherwise it'll still feel hungry. maybe add a handful of chips, pretzels or crackers on the side? heck, no, that defeats the low carb purpose. I'm trying to be healthy. the purpose of adding carbs is to be healthy and properly fueled. suit yourself, I'll see at the candy jar in an hour."
0LCXoyHJJQ4,"hi, hi. would you like some Girl Scout cookies? I really shouldn't. I feel way too guilty. oh, I'm selling them so you wouldn't be stealing them. oh, no, no, that's not what I meant. I just started this new diet and I'm trying to be good. cookies are so bad for you if they're in the house, I just can't stop eating them. no junk in this house, but good luck out there. okay, bye, hi. do you have any of those coconut caramel ones? yeah, lots, those are my favorite too. give me two boxes, that way I can have some later on in the year when you guys aren't selling them anymore. sure? miss Felicia said she can't even keep cookies in the house without eating them all. are they really bad for you? no, food is good or bad. you know how, when you eat too many cookies and your tummy kind of hurts. Miss Felicia forgot how to stop before that point, thanks to something called keto. what do you say the next time? you and I both eat cookies? we practice eating the amount that makes our bodies feel good deal, deal. okay, put me down for the two boxes and I'll see you later. Felicia thinks carbs are scary. she hasn't seen anything yet."
Pjq7JEHFS5A,"check out my giant peanut butter cup. holy sh. Wait, is that a rice cake? yeah, but you'd like never know so good. I don't doubt that's a tasty little, or rather big- snack you got there, but I think I know the difference. I'll stick to these. look how much more you can eat here. it's huge? yeah, it is, but Studies have shown that the volume of food consumed only had a small and short effect on satiety. they also show that when we eat larger portion sizes, we eat at a faster rate, with larger bites, which can delay feeling satisfied, cuz you're just shoveling it in and not actually savoring it. so you're saying we all need to eat teeny, tiny little portions? no, what I'm saying is you need to eat what you find satisfying. if you enjoy the crisp crunch of a rice cake, go for it, but if you want ares's, have ares's. you'll be much more satisfied. what I find satisfying is taking care of my body and being healthy- me too, and that's a big reason why I don't have food rules. it's better not to resist your Cravings. avoiding them just makes you fall to pieces."

VIHn1gCdQNk,"here's everything I eat in a day with no food rules. I like to munch on some granola for carbs on the way to the gym in the morning so I have some fuel in the tank. needed something quick and protein to help my muscles recover. I love these built bars. when I had a bit more time and I was also hungry, I made a little more substantial breakfast, obsessed with taking my usual overnight oat recipes and making it in the Ninja creamy chicken, bacon, ranch tortilla pizza for lunch. and I am on a kick with these little sweet peppers here. Pro tip up level. your peanut butter banana with a little granola. her crunch Obby. I had to share the peanut butter salmon burgers with lemon del mayo. oh so, so good. and then I paired it just with a super easy side salad kit, picked a chocolate at random and ended up being a good one. you guys, it was peanut butter. in the mood for some relaxing, comforting, Vibes made my favorite sugar cookie tea and I added a little bit of caramel syrup. then I took to my new favorite current evening hobby, which is doing paint by numbers. is so relaxing and a great way to unwind at the end of the day."

I'm all for making fun protein filled recipes, but let's not pretend they're the same taste-wise or experience-wise like did you greet me all cheery and have a freshly intoxicating sugary baked smell? uh-uh, you obviously don't know how many calories are in there. actually, I do, and it's really fine. I eat how much feels good without getting a tummy ache and move on with my day guilt-free. would I want to eat them all day, every day? no, that perhaps wouldn't feel good, but you can 1,000% eat them and still be healthy. whatever, it's your funeral, oh please. the stress hormone roller coaster and increased likelihood to bingee because you're depriving yourself really isn't healthy either. and it's going to be your funeral if you keep ruining my cookies. I think they're still good."
UVij6jO6Sg4,"artificial sweeteners are like, so bad for you m are they? let me give you some facts. the average American woman over 20 years old would need to consume 16 to 20 cans of Diet Coke or over 32 Splenda packets daily a lifetime to reach the limit that's considered safe. the estimated average intake is 4.9 mg per kilog per day, which is less than 10% of the ADI. if you prefer to simply not consume artificial sweeteners, that's okay. that's not necessarily a diety choice. ultimately, it matters why you choose what you choose, be it sugar or artificial sweeteners. if someone is trying to avoid a sugar craving by picking a low calorie option, they're more likely to just eat more later on. check out the caption for more. I can't wink."
ZhYmTFz7vyI,"I'm a non-diet dietitian and here's why I'm making high protein ice cream in my ninja creamy. let's just clear one thing up: this is a fun way to enjoy a protein shake, but it is not ice cream. I mean, it's delicious, but that's kind of comparing like apples to oranges. I actually like taking my usual overnight oat recipe and making it in the creamy for a fun breakfast, not a replacement for ice cream. and don't forget: carbs are friends, not faux. this could also be a delicious way to get your muscles some protein after a workout, to help them recover nice and strong and to help you cool off. this one needs to freeze. we'll make this one. check it out. oh my gosh, ice cream like so. while, yes, I'm here for the protein packed goodness, I'm also here for making fruity sorbet or Rich nonprotein packed ice creams with heavy whipping cream and sugar. all of them are great, they're just not the same. highly recommend."

I actually brought some for my chicken salad. it's that low carb living, am I right? well, no, not quite. I also brought some bread, too, to make a Sammy ew. why? carbs just make you fat and I'm trying to get super fit this year hitting the gym after this. okay, first of all, that's not true and Incredibly fat phobic. secondly, I'm all about working on fitness goals. if you want, go, girly go, but low carb diets actually make your muscles feel more fatigued and decrease your ability to work out, not to mention they can actually also cause nutrient deficiencies. oh, what do you know? I've been doing this for like 3 weeks now and I'm fine. let me live my life. you absolutely can. I'm just giving you the facts.

LopSGZOjwFI,"all righty time to eat this. intuitively. might I suggest something? real fast, what I'm doing, what you said, I'm letting myself eat and I love that for you. but what if we worked with a little more structure here? like, well, first of all, what if we focused on strengthening our hunger and fullness cues before we jump to the big tub of ice cream? otherwise, of course, we won't know how to stop eating till we get to the bottom right or feel really sick. okay, yeah, that makes sense, but can you like hurry up and get to the point before this melts? what if we also decide to put this into a bowl, so that we can increase our mindfulness and also give ourselves a pause to see if we actually want more or if we just switched to autopilot mode? huh, you might be on to something, can you? uh, pass me a bowl. gladly, I'll grab two."

A lot of times I like to mix something that's a little heartier, that's got some Fiber, with something that's just straight up delicious. I also like to use the protein shake for the milk for a little bit of an extra fful boost. now we need a fat Source here. I really don't think peanut butter is going to jive with the birthday cake flavor, so coconut flakes it is you. you have permission to add a variety of gent nutrition tidbits to your bowl. or maybe you decide to pour a bowl of Fruity Loops and call it a day, because that's what you're needing or wanting, or is what you have access to. these are just a few ideas to try, if you like delicious."
OnYxiagWdA0,"put that thing down. you do know bananas spike your blood sugar, right. I know that blood sugar is like all the rage right now and it is important, but, PSA, the body can handle a plain banana well. you should at least add some protein or fat to it, ooh, ooh, or pick a super green one. they'll impact it less M I don't want a green banana. that's super firm and way less sweet, so I'll personally be passing on that. and true, adding a protein or fat to a carb can help give you longer lasting energy. I love that tip, but that doesn't mean that if we eat carbs without it, we're going to like spontaneously combust, and sometimes we want that, like before a workout, for example. you know what makes sense that you eat bananas, cuz everything you say is bananas. have fun with your blood sugar crash. you know what's worse than eating a plain banana, not eating a banana when your body needs energy, cuz then you become hangry, Cranky Pants, McGee, with a little blood sugar. just saying."
XLD4ABiQWxM,"I'm a registered dietician and here's what I thought of Costco's new absurdly large food court cookies. I mean they smell incredible, but should anyone really be eating these with that nutrition info? let me be abundantly clear about this: no, these are definitely not the most nutrient-dense thing, and that's okay. and if you did look at the nutrition info, did you see they're goat free?"
qWNTaxLZXZQ,"here's everything I eat in a day with no food rules. started the morning with waffle, Greek yogurt, berries and peanut butter. rushed out the door to meet a friend for coffee. got a sugar cookie latte- delicious cinnamon pecan oats for a more substantial breakfast. obsessed with this, Bri, cranberry and chicken quesadilla- totally ate this straight from the jar. grabbed one of my favorite protein bars. I get these from Costco. very filling. my favorite super easy dinner that I literally call warm salad kit. take any cabbage based salad, take the veggies, sauté them up with some oil, add protein, use a toppings and rice, W it off your dog. for a dessert, I had a frozen s'more. I love these."

I usually watch or listen to something as I eat. this is kind of boring. you know, eating without distractions is super helpful for many people, but for others it might not be like when eating with distractions doesn't impair your ability to listen to your body's cues, when focusing on food increases guilt, or when it's just not feasible, like on really busy days or when you're socializing. so you're saying I can catch up on Real Housewives, go ahead."
b_1BtITs8gY,"I'm a non-diet dietitian and I bought light english muffins, and here's why, whenever I'm picking a carb in the options available, I ask myself if having the whole wheat option would be just as satisfying as picking the white refined option. in this case, the answer was yeah. I honestly wouldn't notice a big difference between the two. then I saw the option for whole wheat or light multi-grain and I was like wtf's. the difference turns out they're pretty close. but the light ones had double the fiber, which can help keep you full longer, keep you regular and benefit things like cholesterol levels. they were also the same price, which is V important to this Midwest Gale who likes to stick to a budget. you can pick the English muffin that makes the most sense for you. it might be different from my choice, but that's why these ones ended up in my cart. Pro tip Greek yogurt, little granola for crunch- oh yeah, delicious."

H? why do you say that? because my girly Health babore, XOXO, posted a study to prove it: the more processess food you eat, the more likely you are to be depressed. so you're asking for it. have you ever thought that people who are depressed are more likely to reach for processed food for comfort and for lack of motivation or desire to prepare food for themselves? just just because two things are correlated doesn't mean one caused the other. oh, you're just making excuses for everyone. no, I'm just explaining how influencers like your girly Health babe skew the research to instill fear. so can I uh, eat my cereal now?"

I don't know, it was some super fancy stuff I got as a gift. oh, I just throw that stuff in the trash when I get it like why would you not just use chocolate protein powder instead? so much healthier? I mean, a warm protein shake is an option, but let's not pretend it's the same as Rich, creamy hot cocoa at all. not every single thing we consume needs to be packed with protein. sure, adding protein can help us feel full and satisfied, but it's not really as helpful when it decreases our enjoyment and satisfaction. whatever suit yourself. I'm going to take a wild guess that you don't want any of these marshmallows more for me."

It's Not Butter, oh heck. no. keto is life. oh, sweetie, don't forget to drink your glass of milk with dinner. hey, sweetie, can you hand me the grass-fed, wild caught oat milk for our smoothies? a moment on the lips, a Lifetime on the hips. it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle."

I've been a not so proud member of The Clean Plate Club since the '90s. how come I can't just stop eating halfway through like Julie? is the rest of this rap actually screaming my name, or is it just me? but I've reached my point limit. so wait, maybe I should be doing keto and just use slices of cheese for a tortilla. I wish eating were as easy for me as it is for Britney. you think there's any seed oils in here? I've never been a big Dieter, but after following babore XOXO, I feel like I'm just super confused about nutrition. like WTF am I supposed to eat? maybe that's why Ashley's only eating veggies. everything else is poison."
01lU6Axt7xw,"[Music]. I cannot stop eating these because they are so good. H. is that the reason? yeah, duh, what else would it be? well, maybe you keep eating it because it is so delicious and when it's gone you're going to feel sad that it's gone. so you keep eating to delay that feeling. H. to be honest, both outcomes are sad. it's sad to have delicious foods still on your plate when you realize your tummy is Comfortably full and satisfied, and it's also sad when we wind up overly full with the tummy ache. huh, you're right, I hadn't thought of it like that before, and there is no right or wrong. you get to choose which one you go with. you can also kind of think of it like finishing a good book. yeah, it's sad when the story ends, but there are so many more Amazing Stories that you have to look forward to, and the same thing goes for food. you know, I think I'm good for now, bummer, but at least I won't feel sad and have a worse tummy ache makes sense."

aahaEOSjUdE,"did you see? Tina lost some weight. good for her for finally taking care of her health. her body may have changed, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's healthier. it's probably best that we don't comment on her or anyone else's bodies, why? I bet she wants to hear the compliment she's probably working so hard, Sydney. on the other hand, girl's getting a little fluffy changes. someone's weight going up doesn't mean bad and it going down doesn't necessarily mean good. yes, when some people make Health improvements, their weight may change, but there are so many other things that could be happening, like depression or unhealthy, extreme dieting. or maybe they've stopped said unhealthy, extreme dieting and are now healthier because of it. I'm just looking out for them. if you really wanted to look out for them, I wouldn't comment on their weight. you could encourage them to work towards feeling their best and honoring their body, whether that means weight gain, loss or maintenance. you're just overly sensitive. it's like you can't say anything anymore. actually, I'm being honest and, yeah, sensitive. maybe you should try it sometime."

I've be got to get the chips. and just a little bite for the road, now that I'm eating intuitively and not dieting, I can do. you even want all of that stuff. I mean, who doesn't want this? at first thought, true, those foods are delicious and can bring so much Nostalgia. but when you actually eat intuitively, Sometimes the best thing is to not get all of the things. it really just depends on the situ situation. if you're wanting them and if they'll feel good- no, I'm always going to want this, no matter what- then you're not actually eating intuitively. you're just not dieting, which is a great step, but it's not the same thing as eating intuitively."

1zP52MVcBwU,"what you doing. I got to eat as many as I can before the new year and they're not allowed. you can still eat all those things in the New Year. actually, the research shows that even the idea of an impending diet sets you up to overeat those things. now it kind of gives you the Last Supper effect and turns you into a vacuum cleaner and you just suck up all the things that you think you're not going to be able to have again. but how can I eat cookies and treats and achieve all the health goals I want for 2024? oh, I'll show you. every day leading up to the New Year, I'm going to share the most essential need to know information before heading into 2024, to improve your relationship with food and, yes, even maintain or improve your health at the same time, if you like. what's the catch? how do I get this? no catch, just follow along here and I'll give it to you straight each day. okay, following Fabo, this will be fun. so can I uh, stop gorging myself with these now?

OxpelrMle14,"during the holidays, one of my favorite treats to make are homemade butter fingers. M the only flower I use is cauliflower. cookies are like way unhealthy. but did you know you can turn an orange into a reindeer except donate the pretzels? processed carbs are basically poison, making my famous seven layer cookie. go big or go [Music] home now, it starts tomorrow. screw cookies. the reindeer had the right idea. you do know they make holiday flavored protein bars, right, all right. 10 for the old Family Recipe. all right, we got butter, flour and sugar. I'm the only one who's going to eat these, aren't? I don't take it personally, Nana. it's crazy times down here."

I'm just being healthy. I'm helping us. I know you think that way, but just waight, girlfriend. oh, don't listen to her. some foods nourish our bodies more and some our souls. we need and deserve both. can you pass me one of those? I remember how much we loved these."
5VlxQgTGC24,"so apparently there's this trend going around where people are no longer eating oats because they're like so bad for you and basically like horse food or something that is outrageous. oats are fabulous. they help keep our blood sugar nice and stable, help us feeling full, and they can benefit our cholesterol levels. these peppermint mocha oats, you guys, I am obsessed with them. I've been eating them all week long. the recipe was just uploaded to the society. save this video. give it a try. you're going to love them as much as I do if look how festive they are."
QobZEL8Fb1Q,"what are you doing? I'm baking a cake, want to help, heck. no, you're pouring a big old cup of inflammation, don't you know? canola oil- and well, all seed oils are like, so bad for you. I know that's what you hear a lot on social media, but it's not true. research actually shows that the Omega 6es, which is what gets demonized, don't actually cause inflammation. but I also heard it contains a toxic chemical that's also found in like gasoline or something that's like microscopic and kind of of a non-issue. but boy, do uneducated influencers like to pull that one out. I mean, sounds scary, huh, I just really still don't think you should be using that. you know you seem kind of stressed and worked up about that. that's actually more likely to cause inflammation and negatively impact your health than my canola oil filed cake. just saying."
sUiRciHb3_4,just because you eat a rice cake doesn't mean you're dieting. just cuz you eat a frozen banana instead of an ice cream bar doesn't mean you're dieting. just because you ordered a skinny latte doesn't mean you're dieting. just because you prefer simple ingredients doesn't mean you're dieting. what makes something diety isn't what you do. it's why you do it.
xJJ0-ywK9UM,"spaghetti squash cottage cheese. you and your cottage cheese girly. what are we making this time? spaghetti squash lasag your bowls, spaghetti squash cottage cheese sauce and then some mozzarella, fat-free Obby. just pop this bad boy in the microwave and Bam meal in minutes. okay, that actually sounds delish. but can I make one suggestion? what well? try full fat cheese. it melts so much better, ooey gooey, and then scoop all of that onto this. ew. no, I don't want to end up being all lumpy looking like the cottage cheese. I want to get lean and toned, high protein, low carb or bust. well, it sounds like we might have a little body image work to do. huh, and I totally support you wanting to get stronger. it's empowering and protein can be helpful, but cutting carbs actually prevents that. it does. no, my fave influencer, Health babore XOXO, swears by it. yeah, maybe spread the word to the fit fam too."
TwRFQQIn3aA,"diet culture. math be like: if you eat one cookie, you'll gain 367 lb. if you add a Sprinkle of cheese to your salad, it now provides zero nutrients. if you eat a sandwich with two slices of bread, you've now gone up four pant sizes. if there are more than five ingredients listed, well, it doesn't matter, cuz you're probably dead. what?"
U0etm5vrL2w,"I'm done with this junk. whoa, what's going on here? cereal is like so bad for you. it's got all of those toxic chemicals in it that just make me feel like crap. I'm only sticking to clean foods from now on, like eggs and oatmeal. I feel so much better. I mean, that looks delicious. but quick question for you: is it really the lack of toxic chemicals that you speak of- which, just to clarify, is inaccurate? all food is made up of chemicals and the ingredients in this box of cereal are non toxic and safe- or is it the addition of protein from the eggs and fiber that have got you feeling better? what are you talking about? well, I was trying to help you make the connection that protein and fiber help you feel better without having to demonize the cereal. but the cereal was the issue. or was it the lack of protein and fiber? it was the cereal. oh, come on, are you cerealously, not going to work with me here?"
3xWvLIbcCcA,"sure, I love Oreos at home. I eat them with. I eat them with peanut butter. that is so weird, so do I."
FVVjNBSA9e8,"check out my sub bun. you mean the cucumber? yeah, it's low carb and low cal. hash Health M. you know I love that you're getting creative with veggies, isn't it fun? I actually have something similar here: chicken salad stuffed cucumbers. oh so you're low carb now too. no, I also packed P chips, grapes and a little chocolate, cuz your girly likes some lunch dessert. carbs are super important, and eating too low calorie actually increases a neurotransmitter called YP that increases your drive to eat carbs. skipping them all together just isn't something I'd recommend. it sounds like you just need more willpower. sounds like you might need a carb, my friend. too low blood sugar, like from not eating carbs, makes you cranky."
Z1egqngvlIY,"what can't cottage cheese do? oh boy, what are we making now? Cheesecake. all you need is cottage cheese, ineg protein powder and some vanilla. blend it, then bake it and voila here, try it. okay, what do you think tastes? the same right? I think it's a fun protein packed snack. I mean, it's pretty much a sweet spin on an egg bake. it's not bad, but it's definitely not the same name at all. if I'm going to eat cheesecake, I'm going to eat cheesecake. oh, come on, but this is so much healthier. I'm going to bring it to Gina's dinner party on Thursday. actually, learning to not feel guilty and finding balance with the real deal is shown to be the healthiest option. I could bring the dessert if you wanted. oh no, no, this will be a hit. am I missing something here, or is she on another planet?"
9OH_uqxVYhY,"one of the best things that I've done for my body image recently is to stock up on new bras- actually, bralettes from parade. bras shouldn't make you think about your body more. that just causes us to ruminate and causes poor body image, and there's a big difference between something fitting your body and fitting your body comfortably. you need something designed with smoothing comfort that literally feels like nothing, which is why I love this seamless, smooth lift triangle bralette, but also because it comes in this cute sherbet pattern- but hurry before it sells out. cuteness also boosts body image. guys, do your body image a favor and get new undies and bralets at 40% off during parades. Black Friday sale use code rules 40 when you shop. the body, diverse, inclusive, fabulous brand that is parade. I am obsessed. I literally have so many of these obsessed."
PvN4K3MQaIg,"all right. does anyone want any more food? before I put it away, how are tummies feeling? look at how colorful this fruit salad is. that can signal that we're giving our body a wide variety of nutrients so that they can feel their best and allow us to run and play. no foods are good or bad. some foods might be more Soul nourishing, and that's okay. okay, sweetie, you said you want some pretzels as a snack. sure thing. what if we try dipping them in some peanut butter to see if they help us feel full satisfied longer? you know what? I'm still kind of hungry, and that's okay. I'm going to go get some more food."
AuTdDqDuEKs,"Rachel looks so thin in that dress. I wish I looked like that. I hate my curves. I hate that my body looks like an 8-year-old boy's. why can't it look like Sarah's? look at her butt In Those Jeans. mine would look like a pancake. I wish I wasn't so bottom heavy. this top would look so much better if I had Julia's perky boobs. oh, my L on my back is killing me from these huge knockers. it's like a workout carrying them around. if only I was as fit and toned as Lauren. I hate how masculine and Meaty my body is. what I wouldn't give for Emily's feminine curves."
Zh6TeYkiSSw,"I haven't eaten all day. I've been saving up for this. oh, do you want a snack? whenever I go into a meal overly hungry, I end up overeating. it's a biological response. plus, I can't even taste or enjoy the food cuz I'm just inhaling it. eating before isn't bad. it actually can be really helpful. stuffing that's a lot of carbs. oh, carbs are great. they're actually our body's preferred energy source. here I'll take them. there is so much sugar and cranberry sauce it is so bad for you. yeah, there can be, but that's okay. the sweet n with the savory turkey- so satisfying. I don't even want to know what the scale is going to say tomorrow. I won't know what it says. I don't weight myself anymore and I just focus on how I feel. it's so much less stressful and it's actually more effective for my overall well-being. remember: your weight is not your worth, nor a direct reflection of your health. this is so good, is it from Costco?"
QGtQ3JzdVr0,"wow, cousin Katie looks amazing. meanwhile I've got my daughter, Cassie, spilled juice all over my pants. I wish I had the time to devote to healthy eating like she does. I mean, I live off of leftover mac and cheese and sandwich crust. she's got it all figured out and I'm a train wreck. I'm miserable and spend all day thinking about food on this diet. it's taking over my life. hope no one notices how gassy this cauliflower stuffing is going to make them. I'd kill to be able to eat anything. like Shannon, I've got about 6 weeks until people go from thinking it's cute how much I eat to how will you lose the baby weight? I feel the pressure already. I wish I was just old and didn't care anymore like Nana, oh dear. I wonder how many calories are in here. look at little Cassie just eating away at her pie without a care in the world. it's been 80 years since I've done that. I hope she can hang on to that and not waste her life trying to shrink her body like I did. I love pie, but I heard Aunt shell say pumpkin pie was fattening. am I fat? is fat bad? maybe I should stop eating this. I got to go ask Mommy."
UnTQnNv9Fb4,"I'm a registered dietitian and this is my favorite recipe for a healthy, guilt-free pumpkin pie. step number one is to grab your keys or find some way to make it to Costco. grab a 3 and2 lb plate of goodness for $5.99. this is guilt free because guilt is an ingredient. all food and beverages are free from it. enjoy your pie however you like it best. if that's getting it from the store, go for it. if you like a less sweet version, or maybe you don't like the crust- well, I don't understand that, but that's fine. you get to decide what is satisfying to you and what makes you feel your best, both mentally and phys. physically. for me, I'll be enjoying this. it is actually the best, and that is a hill I will die on."
WHlJbqpDgxc,"I'm a dietician and these are the snacks I pack every time I travel. I pack a variety of bars for ease. some are more energy dense and some are lighter. packets of nut butter are a must and can be added to anything to make you feel more full, like apples that actually travel super well. I hate plain water, but feel better when I'm hydrated, so I make sure to bring flavor packets. this stuff is just straight up delicious and I like it, and I always like to pick up some candy, cuz. dried fruit is great, but it's not candy. check out the caption for more."
3itb5sjxWuo,"have you tried the trending peanut butter bowl? I see your peanut butter bowl and I raise you a peanut butter protein bowl. I do really dig the peanut butter here, cuz peanut butter can help you feel full. adding protein can help even more. I like to mix mat cereals. a vanilla shake Works fabulously. a little banana for extra Pizzazz. protein, fat carb. the gang's all here. you got to give this a try, m."
V6CuRdDCvWQ,"did you know that you can make an insanely high protein pizza out of canned chicken? protein can help us feel full and satisfied longer and also increase thermogenesis, or the energy that your body Burns, but it's a very small amount and not super impactful. it's actually a myth that your body can only absorb 20 to 25 grams of protein at a meal, but more protein is not always better. putting so much focus on protein could cause you to not get enough other nutrients, like fiber, for example. the biggest thing that I see with this meal is that there's no carbohydrates. low carb diets can show significantly higher levels of binge eating and our body, especially our brain, prefer carbs as energy. when I gave this a go, I was super skeptical, but I was actually surprised at how delicious it was, but adding a source of carbs to this meal can help you feel even more satisfied in reduced binging later. this is not a replacement for pizza, but rather a fun way to eat chicken. check out the caption for more non-diet tips."
dVnpBwl9lFA,"I would gain like 10 lb from eating a single cookie. I used to feel that way too, but the reality is your body doesn't really change after eating a single cookie, even though we physically feel like it does. it's kind of a messed up mind trick that diet culture plays on us called embodiment. what now, embodiment is when we take something like a feeling and we turn it into something more tangible, something we can touch or fix. or do we take what's going on in our minds and we put it on our bodies? what the heck does it have to do with me eating a cookie? we feel that way because of the feelings of guilt and shame. it can feel so much more tangible to fix a body. we're used to doing that with dieting rather than to address our emotions. so you're saying that I'm putting my guilty feelings onto my body. I need to work on eating the cookie without feeling guilty? yes, exactly, or maybe I just need more willpower to not eat the cookie in the first place. problem solved- wait, that's no."
KO_gRb9VQwk,"channeling my inner Joey trani with this recipe, and it literally could not be easier to make and only takes 20 minutes. you just make your meatballs, sear them up, then create them a little marinara sauce hot tub and let them simmer in there for a little bit. pop those babies on some buns, then add some mozzarella cheese on top, then you're going to broil them so they get nice and, ooey gooey, add parsley if you like and enjoy. check out the caption for more recipes and to learn how to eat with no food rules."
wzbF-1tmsFs,"did you know that if you take a chocolate protein bar, battle with it a little bit to get it open, cuz they make it so difficult- put it on a plate and then pop it in the microwave, where there's about a 2C window between uncooked and Burt, and dried to crisp, take it out after a few seconds? if you are left with a warm protein bar that tastes like a warm protein bar, let's just take a second right now to do a little sanity check to make sure I'm not missing something here. regular brownie, warm protein bar- not the same. a warm protein bar is a fun snack to nourish your body, but a regular brownie is going to nourish the soul. both are fine choices, they're just different."
rACQs1LjqrU,"hey, did you know you could eat this whole spaghetti squash for less calories than that measly PL a pasta? yeah, and look how big it is. you'll be full for sure. oh, your stomach would be full, no doubt, but it probably wouldn't be satisfied. you can stuff your tummy to the brim with as many low calorie veggies as you want, but if you're not getting it what it needs like carbs and calories, you're probably just going to end up in the pantry 20 minutes later eating those stale marshmallows, you know, those ones that don't even going to taste good. nuh-uh, did I just call out what happened to you the last time you ate a whole spaghetti squash? shut up.

4zBM81L3k4s,"ooh, what you making. I'm making healthy apple donut pancakes. you just take apple slices, plop them into the pancake batter- I'm using the protein kind- make sure they're nice and coated, then put them in a pan easy. ooh, okay, I got to try these M. they are good, yeah, and so much healthier, for you never need to get donuts or pancakes again. okay, let's not be rash here. you can still enjoy regular donuts and pancakes too. yours are delicious, but definitely not the same. oh, Sweetie, maybe one day you'll care about your health as much as I do. oh, I care about my health. that's why I have no food rules. a balanced approach to nutrition is sustainable and enjoyable. eating mostly Whole Foods is sustainable and enjoyable, don't not worry, I agree."
eGl3HQg-Xqk,"the switch witch has arrived. a what you don't. do that with your kids? no, you must. when they come home with all of that toxic junk, they get to pick five pieces and then the rest it's got to go. I have them set their pale on the porch and then at night I Chuck that and I leave a toy instead. so much healthier. I love that you care about your kiddos nutrition. I do too. I've actually found it so much more helpful and healthy to teach them how to enjoy candy in moderation instead of restricting it. oh, come on. and how can they do that? they can if we teach them how and how do you do that? well, we've got to learn it ourselves first. it takes time to undo all of the Almond mom diet culture nonsense that we've been taught, but man, it feels so good. getting rid of food rules sounds way too scary and way too unhealthy. it actually leads to healthier outcomes than dieting, but suit yourself. what's scary to me is thinking about our little ones growing up to have as effed up a relationship with food as we did."
lkfUQqS_9bA,"out of all three ways. the Third Way is probably my favorite, but I'll let you decide. option number one is to melt some peanut butter with honey and then you're going to add some crushed up corn flakes, allow these to harden in the freezer as you melt chocolate and coconut oil, and then you're going to cover them. the second way you can make these- I was super intrigued by this: take candy corn, melt it with some peanut butter in the microwave, then you're going to put it into a loaf pan again, allow that to harden a little bit and then you're going to cover them with chocolate. and number three: my favorite way to make them is to make your way to the grocery store, grab yourself some butter fingers and open them up. all three of these are healthy and guilt-free, because no one food is healthy or unhealthy and guilt isn't an ingredient. some foods might be more nutrient rich and some others might be more Soul nourishing. we need and deserve both."
89bRE6563D4,"did you know that if you take cottage cheese, add some marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, top it with your favorite pizza toppings, add some cheese, then pop that bad boy in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes and you will be left with a high protein Pizza Bowl. it is actually delicious, but there's one tweak we got to make to it. there's really no source of carb, so grab yourself some P chips to have with it. you'll stay full for much longer. that's better. but one more quick thing here: this is not the same thing as having a slice of pizza which you can do without feeling guilty. both are delicious, but not the same. eat Pizza when you want pizza and have a Pizza Bowl when you want a fun way to eat cottage cheese. both are fabulous."
rRZjG67xc04,"sweetie, you stop guzzling all of that apple cider. there is like so much sugar in there and you should never drink your calories. such a waste. I love apple cider too. it's pretty sweet, huh? you know, when I have a lot of something sweet I tend to get really energized. then it wears off and I get kind of tired. do you ever notice that happened to you? sure you want a donut. let's go pick some apples and then we can slice them up and make apple Donuts. what did you think? we'd be eating carbs, you silly. this is healthier. look at all these Donuts. remember last year when you were so excited and then you ate a few and then you got a tummy ache and upchucked in the car on the way home and it took two weeks for the smell to go away. yeah, Mommy does too. let's just keep that in mind when we're deciding how much of the donuts to enjoy today. okay, we can always have Donuts again. who's ready for the corn maze? you got to get to burning it off. all this fun moment on the lips, a Lifetime on the hips.

cuIEuGTw2yw,"what you doing. oh, I was going to bake some brownies. want to join? yeah, sure, whatever, ug the black beans. actually, I was just going to use this boxed mix. we don't always force ourselves to make healthified recipes anymore. we actually need some oil. can you grab that? don't you mean apples sauce? it's like way less fat and it basically tastes the same. yeah, we aren't afraid to cook with fat anymore either. I mean, using applesauce can be a fun way to incorporate some fruit, but I find that there's so much more chewy, gooey and satisfying this way, and satisfaction matters a ton. what I find satisfying is not seeing a negative number in my fitness pale at the end of the day. ah, what sorry. I just had a little bit of PTSD when he brought up my fitness palale. are you okay? oh, yeah, and you will be too, once you learn to eat with no food rules."
Rttsyy30B7k,"this recipe is about to break the internet. did you know that if you take an apple, cut it into slices and take the core out and top it with peanut butter, melted chocolate and- if you want to get really crazy, some sprinkles, you are going to be left with such a super cute snack that looks like a donut. it is absolutely delicious, but it is not a replacement for a doughnut because it does not resemble it in any other way, shape or form. is this a fun way to eat an apple? absolutely, but if someone tells you to eat this apple donut when you're craving a regular donut, run instead, enjoy a guilt-free donut. you're all guilt-free cuz. guilt's not an ingredient."

Pop these babies in the freezer. once they are Frozen, let me tell you what you're going to bite into these and then realize that they do not actually taste like Snickers. they can be a delicious fruity snack if that's what you're craving, but when you want a Snickers, eat a Snickers. both are guilt-free, cuz guilt's not an ingredient."
XRGMqDY1OZg,"hey, did you see that Tina lost some weight? good for her for taking care of her health. her body may have changed, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's healthier. it's probably best that we don't comment on hers or anyone else's body. why? I bet she wants to hear the compliment she's probably working so hard. well, maybe she lost weight because she was sick or depressed and that really wouldn't necessarily make her healthier, would it, huh? or maybe she's using some unhealthy and drastic measures just to try to live up to society's standard of beauty and if we praise her, we're just going to perpetuate that. oh, you're just being way too sensitive. yeah, maybe you should, uh, try it sometime."

I wish I had more to spend on fun foods for my kids to enjoy. well, at least this chick's getting multiple ice creams and a cake, but she knows how to listen to her body and eat those in moderation. do you think anyone can tell I'm buying this food to go home and binge it all? I bet they're judging everything I'm buying and think I'm so unhealthy. only two more hours until my shift is over. I can do it. I wish I could just shop like a normal person too."

I'm okay, I want to use this. my neighbor, Maiden, canned it from fresh strawberries this summer. it is so good, but she probably used sugar and that's like so bad for you. yeah, I bet she did and that's okay. it's a delicious and B it's made with love and it just nourishes the soul. you know, plain berries can be delicious, but today I'm wanting this. eating sugar just makes you crave it more and then you become an out of control sugar fiend. but don't worry, you can join my 21 day Sugar Detox. we'll fix that. in no time I'll pass on the detox. your body can do that on its own. learning to eat with no food rolls actually has the opposite effects than what you might think. you learn to Crave an overall balanced diet and you don't feel guilty or out of control when you do have the sugary stuff. okay, enjoy your death toast. oh, I will, you, jelly."
eh4WJ8ey4qo,"here's everything I ate in Boston for three days with no food rolls. favorite thing that we ate- it's a tie between Lobster waffle and the cannoli. so even though I'm a registered dietitian, I have not touched a single vegetable today, and that's okay."
8AvQp461Lqo,"time for breakfast. what you making. I'm embracing a life of no food rolles. this is the sixth day in a row I've had this. I'm so glad you're ready to give up dieting and you have full permission to eat this. but I got to ask: are you enjoying this? does it feel good? sure it feels good to break the rules? oh, no doubt. but eating intuitively, with no food rules, isn't just about always picking the sugariest food available. it's about fuing your body in a way that feels good, both mentally and physically. well, I haven't pooped in 4 days and my midm morning sugar crash is pretty bad. I think you might have a skewed, kind of extremist view of the idea of intuitive eating. you're in the place that I like to call not dieting, where you're rebelling against diet culture. but you're not yet fully eating intuitively. intuitive eating should feel good, so it's okay if I go make myself a smoothie instead of eating this. I think I'm going to be sick if I take another bite now. that's an intuitive choice. we're getting somewhere."

WziE8fmd9BI,"smoothies should only have a half a banana. a full one is way too much carbs and sugar. I'm only gonna add half a bananas today for my personal preference if I also add the blueberries I want to add. snacks should always be a hundred calories or less. these little packs are perfect and way healthier than an Oreo. I actually enjoy the light crunchy wafer Taste of these and the grab-and-goat pack is perfect, but they're definitely not a replacement for when I want a real Oreo. skip the carbs and wrap your burger and lettuce. I chose a lettuce wrap so I can have more room in my tummy for fries today. both would have made me feel overly full and I get so much more enjoyment from fries. another day might be different, but today this is what feels good and satisfying."

I hope you're having fun. I was in charge of the snacks today. you guys just burned all those calories out there. we don't wanna. so allow me to introduce you to zero calorie foods. everyone, take a stock and pass it around. we've got some snacks with a little bit of something called protein to help our muscles recover nice and strong, something called carbohydrates to replace all the energy that we just used up here. sweetie, put your jacket on. oh, it looks a little tight. just have to watch what we eat a little bit more. okay here, sweetie, put your jacket on. well, it looks a bit tight. bodies change and that's okay. we'll just get you one that fits more comfortably, okay."

I make them pretty good, yeah, but can you just use egg whites and then load it with a bunch of veggies? why does yours have whole eggs and cheese? did I miss the memo on a cheat day or something? yeah, we don't do cheat days anymore either. those are kind of just planned binges and we now realize the yolk is a nutrient Powerhouse. plus the fat in there is needed for our bodies to actually absorb some of the nutrients from veggies. I knew the future would be weird, but this is just bananas. speaking of bananas, wait till you hear we now make smoothies with full ones, not just half. it's like I don't even know. you trust me, it's a good thing. we've come a long way."
ghGKyrIQG5M,"oh girl, put that thing down. I've got a healthy cookie hack you're going to love. oh boy, what is it? they're my favorite three ingredient banana cookies. you just take a half a rotten banana, mix it with some oats and add in about 2 and 1/2 chocolate chips and voila, it's basically the same as a chocolate chip cookie, but way better for you. I don't think that's the same thing. great for when you want a little light and fruity snack, but I think I'm good with this cookie for now. but there is so much added sugar in there, mine have none wait. did you use monk fruit in instead of sugar? I should have guessed, cuz you care about your health. no, Rachel from down the block dropped him off and uh, I don't think she did, and that's okay. you can enjoy sweets with added sugar and you can do it without guilt and while still consuming an overall balanced, healthy diet. yeah, I highly doubt that rigid diet culture. food rules are unsustainable and likely lead to binge eating. said cookies, that's just the way the cookie crumbles. what's going to crumble is your health. that's a very crummy and inaccurate thing to say."
c4nk7EQ3amw,"we're going to do a little healthy Trader Joe's snack review. is this Greek style elote dip a healthy option? okay, next we have these plantain chips. nutritionally speaking, they aren't that much different than potato chips. all, right on to our next snack: Organic roasted seaweed snacks. I stuck on a roof of my mouth. you guys know those. they're like little pieces of like Listerine. it was a little paper thing and you put on top of your mouth and it kind of like disintegrated. that's what these felt like on the roof of my mouth. so when you hear protein granola, is Joe misleading us here? based on the product, I get the hype. you guys, I dig them.

bMlRCk4XHBE,"breakfast time. huh, wait, are those waffles? yeah, I had a hankering, so I bought a box of Frozen ones. you can have a couple if you want. isn't that kind of a lot of carbs you got going on? oh wait, are those the specialty low carb keto ones? no, they're just the regular all Frozen ones. I like the whole wheat ones for a little extra feel, full fiber and whole grain boost. that doesn't look like a very healthy, balanced breakfast. actually it is. I added some Greek yogurt for a punch of protein, peanut butter for fat, and then I mixed some Frozen BL berries with maple syrup, warmed it up in the microwave for a little bit of a micronutrient boost and to boost satisfaction. I think we have different ideas of what's considered healthy. I used to follow a ton of healthy food rules too, but turns out they weren't as healthy as I thought. now, no food rules. my definition of healthy is waffly different. waffly awfully little food pun. no, are you sure you don't want to bite? not eating enough carbs can make a gal really cranky. might help you."
eqxm-xi3Wy0,"these Frozen s'mores are currently stocked in my freezer and they could not be easier to make. take a chocolate pudding cup. add it to a bowl, fold in some whipped cream. then you're going to take another Bowl. add some whipped cream there and fold in some marshmallow fluff. go ahead and mix that on up too. then you're going to take a plate and put some parchment paper on there. snap some graham crackers in half. you're going to need five of them now. put a dollop of the chocolate, followed by a dollop of the marshmallow whipped cream. then you're going to place another half right on top. toss those babies in the freezer for about 8 hours and get ready to experience some serious deliciousness. you are absolutely going to love these. save this video to give it a try."
JzVkmmi4j1U,"um, those are not muffins, those are cakes. way too many carbs for the morning. oh, I love these. they may not give as long lasting energy as, say, a bowl of oatmeal, but we can still enjoy them. um, peanut butter with added oil and sugar. never would I ever that is so bad for you. the added oil keeps it from separating. the sugar adds a touch of sweetness. if I prefer this kind, or it better fits my budget, that's okay. how are they even selling this junk that's filled with toxic artificial coloring? these were my fave as a kid. the amounts of additives in our food are regulated to Safe amounts. I can serve and eat these guilt-free. I hope everyone who's taking a sample is logging that into their calorie tracker, but I bet they aren't. oh, I've been wanting to try this. don't mind if I do. oh, totally worth the hype. do they know how many calories are in that pizza? so unhealthy, give yourself a death sentence. why don't you look at that cute Fame? I'm having a pizza lunch date. I'm pretty full and satisfied right now, but maybe next time do better. Costco, Costco's the best."
UaJO21-0l0U,"I am back with another full day of eating. I went to the gym this morning. I usually eat granola. on my way there grabbed a built bar that I'm gonna eat. I'm trying something new today. I usually eat some sort of overnight oat for breakfast. usually I use yogurt in it. I used whipped cottage cheese. see if it would kind of taste like cheesecakey. this salad is also so good. I could not recommend it more. I did stop and have some cherries, got this. it's Pizza sprinkle seasoning from Trader Joe's. I'm gonna take one of these and put some cottage cheese on top to add some protein. I really should have grabbed the plate and see how this is. we are having salmon Birds tonight. this is one of my favorite easy dinners to make with this ice cream. there was totally a little bit. and that is a wrap on this day of eating with no food rules.

I'm just cutting through. walk fast. yes, this stuff is a savior. this is full of so many chemicals. the ingredient list is so long. the perfect low calorie lunch to keep me on track. how lazy do you have to be to eat this junk? the rice isn't even made of cauliflower. do better. best desserts ever. yellow polka dot bikini. here I come. don't people know? artificial flavors will basically kill you. where's the wild caught grass-fed oat yogurt? I am so much healthier than everyone else. I am so much healthier than everyone else."
lAt9lUJidoE,"I don't know about you, but I'm the type of girly who firmly believes chicken salad tastes way better with fruit in it. blueberries are in peak season and we picked 15 pounds of them. the other weekend I took my super easy basic chicken salad that I make all the time and added blueberries and almonds. I have been eating this for lunch all week and I could not recommend it more. Super filling, super delish. save this video to try it."
MHx4dSrs_hY,"look, it's iced cream. cauliflower can be anything if you try hard enough. don't eat the cone. I prefer mine in a cup instead of a cone. you'd have to be bananas not to choose this one ingredient: nice cream pot. skip the unnecessary junk and do better. I got this low calorie protein ice cream on sale. it was only 17. if you care about your health, you'll invest in it, so I'm assuming no one wants a Nehemiah Rocky Road."

I wish my body was as toned as hers. she's like all muscle. I really hope losing my period because of my super low body fat doesn't impact my ability to have children. damn, girl lifts heavy. I look so dumb with my tiny baby weights. I feel so manly for lifting heavy. maybe I should take a Pilates. that's way cuter and more feminine. everyone else stays for way longer than me. front desk lady is probably judging me. only two hours and 55 minutes left in my shift. I wish I could be as confident as everyone else and have a normal relationship with exercise too."
BSxtE2kY8V8,"it's okay if you're hungry and need a snack when no one else is. it's okay if the snack you had yesterday doesn't fill you up today. it's okay if you need multiple snacks between meals. our bodies are going to need different amounts of food every single day. feeling hunger is not bad or wrong. it has the cheesy saying goes: you can't live a full life on an empty stomach. snack away, gorgeous."

I'd be gotta get the chips and just a little bite for the road. now that I'm eating intuitively and not dieting, I can do. you even want all of that stuff. I mean, who doesn't want this? at first thought, true, those foods are delicious and can bring so much Nostalgia. but when you actually eat intuitively, Sometimes the best thing is to not get all of the things. it really just depends on the situation. if you're wanting them and if they'll feel good- no, I'm always gonna want this, no matter what- then you're not actually eating intuitively, you're just not dieting, which is a great step, but it's not the same thing as eating intuitively."

I need to know exactly how much I'm eating, otherwise I'll eat way too much. did you know? your body has the ability to do that for you all on its own? no weighing, no measuring. NADA, are you gonna tell me to just listen to my body, because I tried that and it didn't work? it just told me to eat all the things. I felt so uncomfortable and gross and I was like this can't be right, it's not what. what do you mean? if you're listening to your body and it doesn't feel good, you're not actually listening to your body. so you're saying there is hope for me to ditch all this diet stuff. I'm saying I'm sure you can ditch that stuff and I'll tell you all my secrets to make it happen."
Tal7sdZ0ScY,"stop trying to listen to your body. I'm not kidding. the number one mistake I see people make when they try to stop dieting is trying to follow their hunger and fullness cues too early research shows that dieting makes your hunger cues unreliable. so if you try to listen to them- as is, of course- they're going to be all over the place. what you need to do is work on strengthening them, first by undoing the damage of dieting and then listening to them. it'll feel a whole lot better and way less bingy. check out the caption for more on this."

I'm gonna still tastes kind of cheesy. now we add protein powder, almond flour, mix it up chocolate chips. there we have it. Moment of Truth compared to okay, this is a pretty fun way to eat cottage cheese. it also be pretty nutrient dense. I've got some protein in there, some filling fats and it can be fun to try those seemingly wacky food trends that you see on social media. but not everything needs to be healthified. if I want cookie dough, I'm gonna make some cookies and eat the dough without guilt. but if I want a fun snack, sure this might fit the bill. it does taste reminiscent of cookie dough. it's fun, but it's definitely cottage cheese. yeah, are they a replacement for one another? absolutely not save this video. if you want to give it a try or don't, the choice is yours."

I get my dream body, and if I just get all willy-nilly and go get ice cream, that's not gonna happen. is it really a dream body? if it's a nightmare to maintain, it's called sacrifice. yeah, sacrificing, experiencing and enjoying life."

I'll go with this one today, which one has a more fiber and less sugar. I have to pick that one. this ice cream has quite a bit of fat and sugar. might not feel great if I ate it all day, every day, but I can enjoy it guilt-free and in a way that feels good. this ice cream has way too much fat and sugar. not gonna happen. nutrition labels are just data for me to consider. they don't dictate my choices, and it's okay if they don't have one. oh my gosh, this doesn't have a label. what do I do?"

I just did a whole undi restack with these. they're a classic go-to pair that never rolls or digs and the fabric is so buttery soft it's been a game changer obsessed. they're also incredibly inclusive, with sizes up to 5xl. they show real bodies and everything is so insanely comfy. you basically feel like you're going commando. well, I'm not really into spending an arm and a leg on something this nice. you don't have to.

I wish I had more to spend on fun foods for my kids to enjoy. well, at least this chick's getting multiple ice creams and a cake, but she knows how to listen to her body and eat those in moderation. do you think anyone can tell I'm buying this food to go home and binge it all? I bet they're judging everything I'm buying and think I'm someone healthy. only two more hours until my shift is over. I can do it. I wish I could just shop like a normal person too."
v4lRTCVezhA,"I would get like 10 pounds from eating a single cookie. I used to feel that way too, but the reality is your body doesn't really change after eating a single cookie, even though we physically feel like it does. it's kind of a messed up mind trick that diet culture plays on us called embodiment. what now, embodiment is when we take something like a feeling and we turn it into something more tangible, something we can touch or fix. or do we take what's going on in our minds and we put it on our bodies? what the heck does it have to do with me eating a cookie? we feel that way because of the feelings of guilt and shame. it can feel so much more tangible to fix a body. we're used to doing that with dieting rather than to address our emotions. so you're saying that I'm putting my guilty feelings onto my body. I need to work on eating the cookie without feeling guilty? yes, exactly, or maybe I just need more willpower to not eat the cookie in the first place. problem solved- wait, that's no."

0rHqeEmi7IM,"lunch time, same here. I'm starving. what you got there? watermelon duh. did you know? it's like 92 water, so you can eat like so much of it with so few calories. my Gale Health babe- underscore XOXO- says it is like the best summertime volume eating cake. I've been having it all week. for sure it's delicious, but I'm not sure I'd follow that value meeting advice. you said you were hungry, right like starved today, so annoying. well, if you eat a ton of low calorie, high volume foods like watermelon, your stomach is gonna be full, no doubt, but you probably won't be satisfied. you can fill your stomach to the brim, but if you're not giving your body what it needs like calories, carbs, fat and protein, you're probably just gonna end up in the pantry 20 minutes later, elbow deep in the jar in Nutella. that happened to you yesterday, didn't it shut up? call like I see, yeah."
uAqjN-URYS8,"didn't you have toast for breakfast? yeah, one sliced peanut butter banana and one slice with a fried egg, and now you're eating a sandwich. that is correct, very observant of you, isn't that kind of like a lot of bread? wouldn't you like swap a bell pepper in there somewhere? eating bread multiple times a day is totally fine. no, carbs will make you gain weight. firstly, that's very fat phobic and secondly, carbs are actually what makes our brain function properly. they're kind of important. whatever you know, not eating enough carbs also makes you cranky and Moody, just saying."
rWpoxYTWjKE,"hey fit fam. today I'm going to show you everything I eat in a day, but first let me give you a good look-see at how ripped I am. friendly reminder that when a full day of eating leads with a body check, the underlying message is likely: if you eat what I'm about to show you, you will look like this, which is 180, not true? if we all ate the same things and did the same exercise as we, still wouldn't look the same, just like this guy could eat the same things and do the same types of exercise as the big old husky lokai down the street. they still wouldn't look alike. honor what your body needs, not someone else's."

I think you should just walk around naked all day. you delicious snack you. I don't love my dimply thighs, but that doesn't get to ruin my day. my body's feeling a little fluffier today, but it still deserves to be fueled regardless.

I don't need to make up for what I ate by burning it off. it's okay to relax. if I ate in a way that didn't feel good yesterday, I don't need to beat myself up. I'll just use it as a learning experience to help me have a more comfortable outcome next time. yay for learning. I can trust myself around all of the leftovers. swearing them off will only make me want them more. I'll let my body guide what I eat. sometimes that might be more cake and sometimes it might be asking for a vegetable. neither are wrong or bad. that meal that I'm stressing over is less than one tenth of a percent of all the meals that I'm gonna eat this year. that is so not worth stressing over."
DlgUyrTJrXI,"saying I'm obsessed with these is an understatement. let me show you how to make these cookies and cream pudding pops. take one vanilla pudding cup, add it to a bowl and mix it with a half cup of whipped cream. now grab a plastic sandwich bag and add two cookies in there, and this is where you can get some aggression out and crush them up. add your crushed cookies to the bowl and mix it up. I like to add a little bit more crushed cookie to my popsicle mold and then you're going to take your mix and fill them up, pop your Popsicle sticks in and just go back and make sure they're all covered. see how we didn't add any guilt. so great Right. freeze until hardens, usually about four to six hours. save this video to try."

I'm not even touching a vegetable today because no food rules. doing these things solely out of rebellion towards diet culture is still letting diet culture dictate your choices. it's just that now, instead of following, you're doing the opposite. instead, eat something because you're following your own wants, needs and what will feel good, not just because you can, but also choose not to eat something because you're listening to your own needs, wants and what will feel good, not just because you think you shouldn't. that is what living with no food rules truly is."
LrcuiAKQlQ4,"two life-changing bacon hacks you need. let me show you how. I just started cooking my bacon in the oven and I'm wondering why I've not been doing this all along. just line a baking sheet with foil, pop your bacon on there and put it in the oven at 400, starting at 18 minutes. take a peek and, once it gets to your desired level of crispiness, take it out. take your bacon off the pan and pop it onto a plate with some paper towel. I was honestly shocked at how crispy it was. okay. but here's the second piece, and I think this is where the magic is at. allow me to introduce you to freezer bacon. add extra flavor to your meals to make them tastier in 0.2 seconds. I always have freezer bacon on hand. did I mention there's like no cleanup. save this video to try."
QnVZ_mStF_I,"all right, sweetie, we won't be eating for a while, so how about we have a snack now so we don't get too hungry? oh, look at all of this delicious food. now. if our tummies get too full, that's okay. we can make note of what we don't have room for today and we can either take some home with us, or you and I can make a plan to make some another day. how does that sound? oh, hey, Susan, can I ask you a favor? I know you're deep into your keto girl era, but can we please keep food talk neutral and not demonize carbs in front of the little ones? thanks so much. hey, bud. oh, not feeling so good? huh, maybe that second Ice Cream Sandwich wasn't the best choice. but don't worry, eating pest fullness happens to everyone, especially when we get so caught up in the moment and having fun. let's just keep this experience in mind for next time. and how about you and I go sit down for a little bit? sound good."

I wish I could just listen to my body that confidently without feeling guilty. oh man, I've barely eaten all day to save my calories for this. I feel like an out of control, ravenous Beast. guess I'm restricting again tomorrow and Shannon is leaving before dessert. man, what I wouldn't give to not feel as addicted to sugar as I do must be nice. I have got to go. if I have one bite, I won't be able to stop, and I don't want anyone to see that that stays in the privacy of my own home. I wish I could just eat like a normal person too."

I guess someone's deemed it a cheat day. oh, Thomas, you don't need to cook me one of those processed toxic hot dogs I saw in the morning show that for each bite of hot dog you lose five years of your life. why we've got double carbs, hot dog bun and macaroni salad. what are we carbo loading for a marathon tomorrow? do you have any veggies that aren't covered in mayo? I personally would have just used plain, non-fat Greek yogurt. less calories. maybe you cannot take that tip for next time. Nana was asked to bring dessert. I got my famous sugar-free jello with Factory whipped cream. the best part is you could eat the whole thing and it would still only be three points. oh, we were so bad. who wants to go get some steps in and burn it off? let's go."

U-UYkl_V6Bk,"oh my gosh, stop. don't even know what cheese is addictive. oh, is it. yeah, cheese has an opiate like effect that makes you addicted. stop eating the cheese. it's true, I read a study about it, and do you read the part of the study where, in order to induce this opiate like effect, they had to inject this stuff straight into the brains and bodies of rats? that is not a reflection of how we normally eat cheese. even if you eat like a lot of cheese, fine, go ahead and eat it. but when you have to go to cheese rehab, don't come crying to me and say I didn't warn you. well, considering that we have zero research to support that, having some cheese on your salad, a slice of cheddar on your Sammy, or enjoying a wine and cheese night with the gal who's gonna have these claimed effects, I think I'll be fine. but you've gotta ask me if I like cheese. what? just do it? do it? do you like cheese? why? yes, my favorite gouda.

xypVakDwq5I,"okay, bread eggs, oh eggs, like whole eggs. they're a super easy way to add a high quality protein to basically anything. if you're looking to add some protein, just get a carton of egg whites only or, better yet, a protein powder. that way you can keep your eating low fat and low calorie. kind of sounds like you're stuck in 1998.. welcome to 2023.. we embrace the whole egg like the nuggeted goodness that it is. eggs provide essential vitamins and minerals for Healthy Living, Like choline, vitamin B12, iodine. that's why I take a Daily Greens powder. it's packed with nutrients. I mean that is one way to get your body some nutrients, but even then, the egg still provides a unique nutrient package that just can't be beat. like the lutein and zeaxanthin, they help protect our eyes from Blue Light. eggs are actually really great for us. they're not just for making cakes a cake. how unhealthy. I hope that was a joke. are we done with this whole interrogation thing, or are you going to tell me 87 reasons why I shouldn't have bread on my list too?"

Oh, don't beat yourself up. it happens I've got to cut back this week: no carbs, and I don't even want to see a dessert. maybe not the best idea. what if this week, instead of focusing on taking things away, you focus on adding in things that would help make you feel good? studies show that restriction actually makes us feel more out of control. I guess that's an idea. and what if you looked back on this weekend non-judgmentally and just reflected, taking note of what felt good and what didn't, and just making note of anything that you might want to change for next time, rather than just repeating the cycle? that's another idea. this approach is actually much more sustainable and it's going to give you a better result long term. doesn't it just feel better to give yourself some self-compassion versus being your own personal bully? okay, I can try that. I'll add in my green juice this week and then I'll make note of any other post weekend cleanses I might want to try next time. oh, not quite."
6R8ULeFu4Nw,"all right. does anyone want any more food? before I put it away, how are tummies feeling? look at how colorful this fruit salad is. that can signal that we're giving our body a wide variety of nutrients so that they can feel their best and allow us to run and play. no foods are good or bad. some foods might be more Soul nourishing, and that's okay. okay, sweetie, you said you want some pretzels as a snack. sure thing. what if we try dipping them in some peanut butter to see if they help us feel full and satisfied longer? you know what? I'm still kind of hungry, and that's okay. I'm gonna go get some more food."
hEruAgRUCLk,"time for breakfast. what y'all making? I'm embracing the life of no food rolls. this is the sixth day in a row I had this. so glad you're ready to give up dieting and you have full permission to eat this. but I gotta ask: are you enjoying this? does it feel good? sure it feels good to break the rules? oh, no doubt. but eating intuitively with no food rolls isn't just about always picking the sugary food available. it's about fueling your body in a way that feels good, both mentally and physically. well, I haven't pooped in four days. in my mid-morning sugar crashes- pretty bad. I think you might have a skewed, kind of extremist view of the idea of intuitive eating. you're in the place that I like to call not dieting, where you're rebelling against diet culture. but you're not yet fully eating intuitively. intuitive eating should feel good. so it's okay if I go make myself a smoothie instead of eating this. I think I'm gonna be sick if I take another bite now. that's an intuitive choice. we're getting somewhere."

I wish I wasn't so bottom heavy. this top would look so much better if I had Julia's perky boobs. oh, my land on my back is killing me from these huge knockers. it's like a workout carrying them around. if only I was as fit and toned as Lauren.

I'll do better tomorrow. well, I guess I don't need to eat dinner now."
FTuTetgyTfg,"here you go, sweetie. how can you feed your child that toxic junk food isn't toxic? I'm teaching her how to have a healthy relationship with all food, even the ones that I call more Soul nourishing but you call junk food, so that way she doesn't grow up to feel out of control around them like I did. you should really be teaching her that food is medicine and to treat her body like a temple, not a trash can. oh, honey, how about you go over there and play with Harper? okay? all I'm saying is that, as moms, we need to protect our children, and part of that is not feeding them toxic chemicals. oh, I get it. now we need to save the toxins so that they can be shot into your forehead as Botox. excuse me, let me be clear. I have no problem with botox, but what I do have a problem with is hypocritical nutrition advice."

I can just feel the toxic sludge building up in your body from eating so unhealthy, and you're eating carbs. what I better go before it seeps into me and I need to drink like five of these detox juices. what's toxic is taking advice from influencers who have no regard to how the human body actually works."

I don't think those pass. but take these highly processed supplements that contain a billion things you probably don't even need. can you both just shut up? you're making this really confusing and way more complicated than it needs to be."

I mean, who doesn't want this? at first thought, true, those foods are delicious and can bring so much Nostalgia. but when you actually eat intuitively, Sometimes the best thing is to not get all of the things. it really just depends on the situation. if you're wanting them and if they'll feel good- no, I'm always gonna want this, no matter what- then you're not actually eating intuitively, you're just not dieting, which is a great step, but it's not the same thing as eating intuitively."

KUrBFb_zz-g,"the non-night space had just gone too far. some people do need to lose weight for their health. I get why you feel that way. we've been taught that weight equals health for so long. but if someone is really looking to improve their health, focusing on weight loss is the last thing they want to do. how can you even say that? do you not want people to be healthier? I know it sounds wild, but there's no clear evidence that weight loss itself is what improves our health. so what exactly do you suggest people do instead, Miss anti-weight loss? okay, so, firstly, I'm not anti-weight loss. it can be a thing that can naturally happen when you start to listen to your body. I am kind of anti-shrinking your body at all costs Beyond where it wants to be. at same thing, no, it's not. anyway, I recommend focusing on health promoting habits that actually are correlated to significant increases in our health, things like honoring your hunger and fullness cues or moving your body- but won't those things cause weight loss? for some, weight loss might be correlated. for others, it might not. think of it this way. in the summer, more people go to the beach. that means more."

Are you seriously telling people not to eat Whole Foods? obsessing over eating healthy isn't healthy. how dare you tell people not to care about their health? just because you can't pronounce an ingredient doesn't mean it's bad for you. okay, so we just shouldn't care about the quality of food we put into our bodies. honor your cravings when you have them, instead of trying to avoid them. what kind of dietitian are you telling people to just eat ice cream all day? get a grip and some willpower. gaining weight does not automatically make you unhealthy. so you're saying we can all just eat ourselves into Oblivion all day, every day, and we'll still be healthy. yeah right, there's nothing special about lemon water. it's water. you can go to hell."
MQ9YWKtBoGM,"hey, healthy Hustlers. today I'm going to show you my grocery haul and give you some of my best tips for healthy eating. so I went to my local Whole Foods- it's the only place I ever shop- and I got these organic, non-GMO, locally grown, pesticide free apples. conventionally grown produce is trying to kill you. avoid buying anything that's in a 10 foot radius of that stuff. that's why they put these ones in a different section, so the toxins don't seep in. oh, I'm excited about this one. it's a grass-fed salmon fillet that was wild, caught by the bare hands of Channing Tatum. then, of course, I'd like to have something sweet on hand for those cravings, and I found these raw, unprocessed cacao nibs. they're so fresh they actually still have some dirt on them. avoiding anything that's processed is imperative to your health and wellness Journey if you don't want to die like yesterday. anyway, whenever you're grocery shopping, shop the perimeter of the grocery store and never buy anything that comes in a package that indicates that it's processed and it's likely to have a long ingredient list full of junk and chemicals. only eat."

DrlpdTZ7yN8,"so the issue with social media is that it kind of shows you a false idea of what intuitive eating actually is. it means a lot of people to just be in the not dieting phase, as I call it, and they're not actually eating intuitively. if you are eating with no food rolls and you're like this just doesn't feel very good to me, that might be a sign that you're not actually eating intuitively, or just not dieting, which is a great step. but bottom line eating intuitively should feel good and if it doesn't, that means there's probably some gaps that we gotta fill. I have a super quick quiz that you can take. it literally will take you 30 seconds that will tell you if you are actually an eating intuitively or not. a lot of people aren't, and you want to know that ASAP so that you don't go too far down to dig yourself a hole and also just confirm like: okay, cool, I'm on great track, so I'll link that here."

I tell you the story for two reasons. first is that if you are working on improving your relationship with food, know that we have been taught this stuff from such a young age. it's kind of like we were told two plus two equals 87 and now trying to understand two plus two equals four. that's gonna take some time. and secondly, let's be careful about the messages that we tell younger Generations. role modeling a healthy relationship with food ourselves can help save them a lot of time in the future. this one's for you, Mr P."

DvpPj7kHetw,"shouldn't you be using cauliflower rice for that, to avoid the carbs? actually, adding carbs to the meal is partly why I want to add it. it's actually a little bit of gentle nutrition. our bodies need carbs to functionally and feel their best. I doubt that's true and even if it is, couldn't you be using, like brown rice or quinoa or something? anything that's not a whole grain is basically just like eating spoonfuls of sugar. it is true, no matter how much keto babe, 827 posts otherwise, and personally I don't find brown rice or quinoa nearly as satisfying. there are other sources of whole grains that I'm okay with, like bread, so no worries there, I'm just gonna stick to the white rice that is is so dumb. you know I've got a fix for your irritability. it's called eating carbs and Foods you actually like. plus, you'll probably be a lot less gassy, because that cauliflower takes trouble and everyone can attest to that."

H3Kjnr5D_7I,"eight meals bigger than your head. okay, let's talk. the goal is to still fill up your stomach, but to eat less calories overall, and the stretch receptors that we have in our stomach are one way that our bodies signal to us that we're full and satisfied, that we've had enough food. but our bodies are smarter than that. they'll realize. oh so that was just a bunch of volume, not actually the energy and the fuel that I needed. not only is focusing on volume eating likely not to leave you feeling full for very long. it's likely that when your hunger comes back, it's gonna come back stronger. I mean, having a meal that's larger than like the size of a pea can be satisfying, let's be real. but when you leave out the actual energy that your body's needing, like calories, carbs and fat, that volume eating is likely just gonna backfire. be wary of focusing on only valuating. you don't always need to stuff your tummy to the brim to be satisfied.

I don't believe you. that does not actually work. what doesn't work are diets.

I basically add it into like all my cheese dishes. it's kind of one of those things that's like: why wouldn't I? it's super high in B vitamins, including vitamin B12. I get the Trader Joe's brand, but you can find it basically in any grocery store. it's also gluten, sugar and soy free. unlike other yeast, this is actually inactivated, so there's no living things that you're eating.

DJKIqcUW5-I,"here's some things I would tell my teenage self, now that I'm a 27-year-old registered dietitian. number one: you need to eat more than 1,200 calories. I know 1,200 calories is like the magical diet culture number, but that is actually the amount of calories that a toddler needs, or like an elderly bedridden patient, which you're neither. so eat more. number two: you know the saying that's going around right now: that's like nothing tastes as good as skinny feels. I challenge that and say: have you ever had Taco Bell and some donuts and watch your favorite movie with your best friend? number three: your worth is not equal to how small you can get your jean size to. number four: feeling like passing out on the regular because you hadn't eaten all day and then you ate finally at like 8:00 pm, is not normal, nor is it good for you. food is fuel, not the enemy. number six: stop weighing yourself every day and then allowing whatever numbers on the scale to dictate your mood for that day. number seven: it's not normal to have so much anxiety regarding food. number eight: humans were not meant to count every single thing that they eat every single day for the rest of their lives. just go ahead and delete that calorie counting app. number nine: punishing."
zN301OIcPws,"here's everything I bought at Aldi. as a dietitian, it's been a hot minute, since I've lived in the same town as an Aldi and I forgot how much I love this store, of course, starting with our produce, because that's usually the front of the store. we have our carrots, we have our strawberries, we have our blueberries. I love my micronutrients- what can I say? and I got some milk and some yogurt because I'm not afraid of dairy. and then I got some chicken broth. I like it better than the stock because it does have more protein and it's an easy switch. I got some chicken breast and then I got this rotisserie styled P chicken so I don't have to mix them because I'm lazy and because I'm in my sandwich. I chose these two options because they have a lot of multi-grains and some fiber in them and I just think it's a good addition to what I'm eating, my sandwiches. I also like getting my protein then, so I got this waffle mix and those protein bars. honorable mention for the baby Bell cheese. I love you so much. and just because I'm a dietician doesn't mean I'm dead. so of course, I got my sweets, I got my cookie dough and my dark chocolate. I am good and my toddler has a very specific palette and that palette is chicken fries and fruit snacks. and I don't care if Moms come for me that, I'm just happy she's getting calories, okay. and then I got these garlic knots because I passed them and I was like you're coming home with me and this."

I'm using just plain non-fat grap yogurt, just plain nothing. you could mix flavors if you want, but I just want regular old PL and I'm going to use some cacao powder. cocoa powder works just as good, probably like a teaspoon- two teaspoons, depending on how chocolatey you want it, because I'm not a psycho. I'm going to add some sweetener, because Cacao is actually really bitter, and then obviously there's no flavor. in my plain Greek yogurt I'm going to add a little bit of these Stevia drops. um, do it to taste.

I have my undergraduate in nutrition, I have my Master's in nutrition and I am a registered dietitian and I cannot pronounce about 90% of those words there- a super outdated and irrelevant way of thinking when it comes to food. number four: 1,200 calories is the amount of calories a toddler needs, not an adult. number five: your body is going to change depending upon what season you're in, and that is okay. do you want to know why you can't fit into those old genes from senior year? because you're not a senior in high school anymore, you're a 30-year-old mother. it's okay if your body is changed. fat diets are stupid and the diet industry wants you to fail."

5Hfq_GXHxV4,"here's how this registered dietitian plans the weekly groceries. the first thing I like to do is plan out each night's dinner- I definitely make sure to a lot for leftovers, new recipes and some old recipes that I know my family likes- and then, with those meals in mind, I go through what I have in my kitchen now and then I make my grocery list according to what I have in my current inventory. I like to ride out each night and then write down what ingredients I need for each night that I don't have on hand, and then I make a miscellaneous bar that I'll add things that aren't necessarily for those dinners, like bread, shampoo, things like that. and because I'm a mom of a feral toddler, I like to order my groceries online. but I also like to order them online because a lot of the times the coupons are readily available and you can just click them rather than if you were in store, you'd have to go and find them because we are Balling on a budget."

I will be having these every single day of my life. are you kidding me? chocolate milk, I'm so excited. and then I got a crap ton of eggs, because me and my daughter eat so many eggs and I don't know how Costco makes money off their chicken. like, look how many chicken I got. look how many chickens."

m3aj2HDwt18,"here's some nutrition facts from a registered dietitian that you may not have known. number one: if you're someone who says you avoid preservatives at all costs and you still eat salt, you're a liar. salt is a very common preservative. number two: if you're someone who says you avoid pesticides at all costs but still drink coffee, you're a liar. caffeine is actually a naturally occurring pesticide. and number three: if you're buying organic because you think they don't use pesticides, that's incorrect. Organics still use pesticides, they just use different ones. number four: if someone says they don't eat processed foods and they wash an apple before eating it, they're Liars. the term process can also include washing, cutting, preparing the food. it is a way overused and fear-mongered word that a lot of influencers like to use. and number five: unless you have a certain medical condition that requires you to cut out certain foods in certain food groups, a balanced diet of any and all foods can and will fit."

I'm a registered dietitian and I'm going to tell you what to add and when to your dishes so you can add really easy nutrition. today we're talking about a really requested ingredient: chia seeds. now you can add chia seeds to a lot of dishes, but today I'm going to add them into my oatmeal. you can add it to smoothies, yogurt or even baked goods to enhance that nutrient profile. chia seeds are super high in fiber, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. I will say you may want to pace yourself if you have tummy issues, because that fiber can really be hard on the gut sometimes. in about two and a half tablespoons you get about five grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber. I will say it doesn't really have a flavor, but it definitely does have a texture. Pro tip: after you're done eating the chia seeds, make sure it's not stuck in between your teeth. I may have learned that the hard way. chia seeds come from a Chia plant and even though they're small, tiny seeds, they definitely have a ton of nutrients in them. it's a super simple way to add nutrients into your foods. you can usually find them somewhere in the baking aisle. cheers."

waiQjLsFlao,"why the heck are you not adding this into your dishes to get really easy nutrients? I'm Sarah and I'm a registered dietitian. I'm going to teach you what to add and when to your dishes to add really easy nutrients. today we're doing my probably favorite add-in, and it's nutritional yeast. what I love most about nutritional yeast is that it's a complete protein, so even if you're vegetarian or vegan, you can add it to your meals. another great thing is that in just two tablespoons, you get about nine grams of protein and four grams of fiber. I basically add it into like all my cheese dishes. it's kind of one of those things that's like: why wouldn't I? it's super high in B vitamins, including vitamin B12. I get the Trader Joe's brand, but you can find it basically in any grocery store. it's also gluten, sugar and soy free. unlike other yeast, this is actually inactivated, so there's no living things that you're eating. I'm just going to add a tablespoon to my Mac and Cheese and just stir it in. so easy, so delicious, if I might say, and I feel like it's one of those ingredients that not a lot of people know about. cheers."

h1HN1mUtlBE,"here's what your favorite foods say about you, and I'm a registered dietitian, so this might be a little harsh. all right, number one: if your favorite food is pizza, nice. but number two: if your favorite food is sushi, me too, hold on. but number three: if your favorite food is a cheeseburger, I like it. it's not my job as a dietitian to judge you or demonize the foods that you like or the foods you have access to or the foods you may not be allergic to or so many other different variables. it's my job to give you some tools that you can put in your back pocket and you can utilize if you want to, but it's certainly to not demonize or judge you for any of your food choices. keep that in mind. when you find yourself scrolling on social media and you see someone demonizing other foods but gives you no explanation as to why, or site studies, that is a massive red flag."
0pCBZYrGWqY,"hear my thoughts on nutrition Trends and fads is a registered dietitian. number one: you don't need to detox. that's why you have a liver and kidneys. if someone is telling you you need an exogenous detox, they're trying to get your money. number two: the keto diet was intended for the population of children with epilepsy. carbs are not bad for you. they're actually the preferred fuel source for the brain and body. adding lemon to your water will make it tastier, but it will not detoxify your entire body, like a lot of people claim on the internet. the only way to boost or increase your metabolism is by building lean muscle mass. Fresno, one food or drink that will increase your metabolism for an extended period of time. to even make it matter, 1200 calories is the amount a toddler or a 98 year old bedridden patient needs. if you're not either of those, then you probably need more calories. the macronutrient fat or dietary fat does not inherently make you fat. it's the excess of calories that contributes to adipose tissue or body fat. sweet potatoes are not inherently healthier than white potatoes. they just have different nutrients. if a food product is high calorie, it does not automatically make it unhealthy, just like if a food product is low calorie, it does not automatically make it healthy and, last but not least, there's no such thing as a fat burning food or drink."
wkvxzcQEXoE,"do you need a super simple, thinner, and I mean like really simple? well then, let's make three ingredient chicken nuggets. no, seriously, all you need is some barbecue chips, some barbecue sauce and some chicken preheat. oven to 375.. add the chips to a gallon Ziploc baggie. be sure to squeeze all the air out, and then we're just gonna start crushing to get our bread crumbs- whatever means you think is necessary- and really get out all your anger. you want it about this consistency. chop up two to three skinless chicken breasts into tiny nuggets. add one cup of whatever barbecue sauce you prefer to a mixing bowl. okay, last time I posted this, this was really controversial. in regard to the three ingredient title. this is optional, so it's still three ingredients, but I like to add these just for a little bit more flavor. so, with that being said, season a measure with your heart with some garlic powder and onion powder and some kick and chicken, if you prefer. add your nuggets to the barbecue mixture and coat evenly. take a nugget and put it into the coating and then add to a parchment lined pan. line them up like, so place them to the oven for about 12 to 15 minutes."
9r3uCzlBHIg,"I'm a dietitian and a mom who does baby lead weaning. here's how I made my eight-month-old's breakfast: get some blueberries and add them to a bowl and mash them up really well. then you're going to add one egg, just a little bit of milk- whatever milk you prefer- and then you're gonna add some cinnamon and then just a hair of vanilla extract. mix that up really well and then you're going to cut the crust off your bread, dip your bread into the mixture, then spray some non-stick baking spray onto your pan and then put those on there and cook them all the way through. it's very important to cook that egg all the way through. then I just cut the French toast into some slices and I'm going to add some banana and some avocado as well. also, it's very important that you've already introduced wheat, Dairy and egg before making this recipe."
EaOrwg8zwSk,"man, i think i maybe need to lose some weight. have you ever thought about cutting out carbs and making it part of your personality? what no, my body needs carbs, and i think keto should only be used for medical purposes. do you like being told what to do and slash when to be hungry? what no, i like listening to my body's cues. well, have you sorry? well, have you ever considered me? no, you're the amount of calories a toddler needs. you don't even have enough energy to stand up. you thought about me, though. right, right, i'm a little pricey, but that's okay, right? ah no, definitely not. um, i would have like zero fiber intake from you. well, what about me? i can help your body. no way, you're just a marketing gimmick. i have a liver and kidneys that detox my body by themselves. um, excuse me, i could probably help. i won't make you restrict anything and i won't make your life miserable. get a load of this guy. she steals everyone from us. i like you. i think you're gonna be sustainable for me, really yay."
