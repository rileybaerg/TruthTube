But both women and men are humans, aka Homo sapiens (crazy, I know!)‚Ä¶

And humans thrive on a diet that is evolutionarily appropriate and ancestrally consistent - I believe an #animlabasd diet is the best incarnation of this!

At certain times of the month, like the second half of the menstrual cycle (the luteal phase), women may need more carbohydrates from fruit and honey‚Ä¶

But organs (either fresh or desiccated like @heartandsoilsupplements), meat, fruit, honey, and raw dairy are the most nourishing and least toxic foods for both men and women‚Ä¶ 

My girlfriend is a great example of this. She THRIVES eating this way.

And I have heard from SO MANY women that cutting out vegetables, and focusing on meat and organs with some fruit for carbohydrates, significantly helped with gas/bloating, weight loss, sleep, libido, etc‚Ä¶ 

Women have traditionally been told that salads are the way to starve yourself to a good body‚Ä¶ that is pure bullshit. 

Ladies, if you want a strong body and fat loss without bloating, lose the salads and focus on meat and organs with some fruit and honey for carbohydrates‚Ä¶

585,Paul Saladino MD,7IyFfrcWVOE,Do Not Fear the Sun! #shorts,"You‚Äôve been told to stay out of the sun and to wear chemical laden sunscreen all of the time (even indoors)‚Ä¶

You‚Äôve been told that you can take a vitamin D pill instead of being in the sun‚Ä¶

You‚Äôve been told that any time in the sun will accelerate aging, wrinkles and skin cancer‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm calling bullshit on all of this!

Riddle me this, why do tan people look more attractive? 

Why does it feel good to get the sun on your skin? 

Why are you happier in sunnier places? 

Why does being in the sun fix almost ALL seasonal affective disorder? 

The answer to all of these questions is simple: because we evolved in the sun and its light is incredibly valuable for us as humans! 

Yes, we all possess different amounts of melanin in our skin at baseline-this will determine how fast you will burn when you haven‚Äôt been consistently exposed to the sun‚Ä¶

Yes, if your ancestors are from Northern Europe you will burn faster than me (my ancestors are from Sicily), but this doesn‚Äôt mean you should avoid the sun! 

Consistent, appropriate levels of sun exposure will also lead to increased melanin in the skin and you will get benefits like nitric oxide, endorphins, cholesterol sulfate, vitamin D, circadian rhythm entrainment, and increased testosterone and other sex hormones (yes these are increased by full spectrum sunlight exposure)‚Ä¶PMID: 34433056

UVB light has also been shown to increase alpha diversity of the gut microbiome‚Ä¶ PMID: 31708890 

I‚Äôve done multiple podcasts on sunlight and skin cancers (Fundamental Health podcast) if you want a deep dive there. I believe seed oils are the major drive of skin cancers, not the sun. But this doesn‚Äôt mean I want you to get sunburned!

Don‚Äôt fear the sun my friends. Celebrate it with as few clothes on as possible!

3,Nutrition By Kylie,dI-Be4IehyQ,"Instead of sheet pan dinners, try a sheet pan breakfast #sponsored @American_Heart","Instead of sheet pan dinners, try a sheet pan breakfast! #sponsored @incredibleegg is a national supporter of American Heart Association‚Äôs Healthy for Good initiative. 

As seen in many of my breakfast videos, I love using eggs since they‚Äôre a versatile, high-quality protein.  Despite popular belief, eggs can be absolutely be part of a healthy diet that includes a variety of nutritious foods! 

Sweet potato egg hash recipe (this recipe is AHA Heart-Check certified):
- Preheat the oven to 425ÀöF and place a rimmed baking sheet in the oven while it preheats.
Add 1 lb of 1/2-inch diced sweet potatoes, 1/2 cup diced red or yellow onion, 1 diced red bell pepper, 1 diced green bell pepper, 1 tbsp oil, 1/2 tsp smoke paprika, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp ground cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp salt and black pepper to a large bowl and stir to combine.
- Remove baking sheet from the oven and coat with 2 teaspoons oil. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to spread potatoes and vegetables out evenly onto the baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally during cooking time, until sweet potatoes are fork-tender, about 18 to 20 minutes. 
- Move vegetables away from the sides, toward the center of the baking sheet (to create a mound for adding 4 eggs). Use the back of a spoon to create 4 wells in hash. Crack one egg into each well. Season with salt and pepper. Bake until whites are set and yolk is jammy, about 8-10 minutes. 
- Drizzle 1 tbsp red wine vinegar over everything and garnish with 2 tbsp chopped chives just before serving.
 

Additional notes:
- Be sure to keep potatoes to a ¬Ω-inch size so that they cook evenly and quickly.
- Cracking the egg into a bowl first makes it easy to remove any rogue eggshell that may end up in the egg when it‚Äôs cracked.
- The USDA recommends cooking eggs until the yolk and whites are firm.

Miso soup is one of my favorite comfort foods.  Though it can be high in sodium, it can also be high in nutrients!  The miso contains probiotics, the tofu adds protein, and the many vegetables you can add to It (green onions, wake, mushrooms, etc.) provides vitamins and minerals.  

1. Combine 2 tsp dashi (I like Ajinomoto Hondashi) and 4 cups of water and bring to a boil 
2. Reduce heat to low.  This is an important step because boiling miso can make it lose its flavor and nutrients!
3. Strain 3 tbsp miso (I used Hikari Organic Red Miso) through mesh strainer.

146,Nutrition By Kylie,-ZDKZzWfNxI,What this dietitian brings for a snack in Hawaii #shorts,"This dietitian‚Äôs (Hawaii) snack pack PART 2 üå∫üå¥

This may be your first time (or second time, if you follow me) time seeing a snack pack made for people from Hawaii.  Despite the cultural diversity of the United States, there‚Äôs a significant lack of culture representation when it comes to what our society views as ‚Äúhealthy eating‚Äù.  

Growing up in Hawaii, my meals didn‚Äôt always look similar to the healthy meals recommended by health care professionals.  My family‚Äôs Thanksgiving dinner featured chow fun and rice instead of cranberry sauce and green bean casserole.  Kalua pork was much more common than glazed ham and white rice was a much more popular option than quinoa.  Without proper education, I couldn‚Äôt understand what a balanced diet looked like if it wasn‚Äôt chicken, brown rice, and broccoli.  

Culturally appropriate nutrition guidelines and recommendations are essential to inclusive care.  The lack of cultural competence among dietitians can perpetuate health disparities among marginalized and diverse communities.  As a dietitian, I love learning about other foods so please comment your favorite cultural foods below, if you have one!  

I‚Äôll provide more info on some of my fave local snacks below if you‚Äôre interested in learning about them:
- Hawaii Pineapple is SO delicious when it‚Äôs fresh.  They‚Äôre a great source of vitamin C and manganese.  Pineapples are also the only known source of bromeliad, an enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties!  
- As I mentioned in my last Hawaii snack pack post, li hing mui is a popular powder that locals love to put on EVERYTHING (fruit, arare, candy, etc.)!  
- Red iso peanuts are peanuts that are encased in a crunchy shell lightly flavored with soy sauce and nori (seaweed).  They‚Äôre a fun and satisfying treat!  
- Wasabi peas are a spicy, crunchy snack that has some fiber and protein.
- Tako (‚Äúoctopus‚Äù in Japanese) used to be one of my favorite snacks as a child!  It has a chewy texture and can be a great, portable protein option.

As someone who struggles to make breakfast every morning, overnight oats are one of the easiest ways for me to get in a satisfying and delicious meal!  I‚Äôve tried many overnight oats recipes, but this is one of my favorites.  

Overnight oats is typically made in a mason jar, but I often found it difficult to mix the ingredients together, especially when I used my small mason jar.  Once I prepared my overnight oats in my snack box, I never looked back!  Not only is it portable, but it‚Äôs also easier to mix and saves me time in the morning by allowing me to store toppings in the same container but separately from the oats.  *Snack container listed on my Amazon storefront*

Recipe:
- 1/2 cup oats
- 1/4 c plain Greek yogurt
- 1 tbsp chia seeds
- 3/4-1 tbsp maple syrup
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup almond milk (or whichever milk you prefer!)
- Cinnamon

Topping:
- Diced apples
- Chopped pecans
- Drizzle of maple syrup

(I listed the ingredients I used below on my Amazon storefront!)

1. Combine 2 tsp dashi (I used Ajinomoto Hondashi) and 4 cups of water and bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat to low.  This is an important step because boiling miso can make it lose its flavor and nutrients.
3. Strain 3 tbsp miso (I used Hikari Organic Red Miso) through a mesh strainer.  
4. Add wakame, silken tofu, and green onions.  

Miso soup (along with any food that includes dashi) is one of my favorite comfort foods.  Though it can be higher in sodium, it can also be high in nutrients!  The miso contains probiotics, the tofu adds protein, and the many vegetables you can add to it (green onions, wakame, mushrooms, etc.) provides vitamins and minerals.

Hawaiian boiled peanuts and dried ika can still be delicious sources of protein while li hing fruit, hurricane popcorn, and taro/sweet potato chips can be great sources of fiber.

If you‚Äôre allergic to nuts (or just dislike nuts for any reason), this snack pack is for you!  For a balanced snack, I like pairing fiber-rich carbs (i.e. whole grain crackers, clementines, cucumbers) with protein (pumpkin seeds, edamame, and roasted chickpeas).  Though so many people like edamame, they always seem surprised when I mention that they make great snacks!  They‚Äôre high in protein and vitamins and are absolutely delicious.

Healthy eating doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive!  Though sticking to a limited budget can certainly make it more difficult, look for the following:
- Veggies (e.g. frozen spinach, canned green green beans, diced tomatoes)
- Protein (e.g. frozen fish, frozen turkey burgers, canned beans)
- Starch (e.g. pasta, rice)
- Healthy fat (e.g. olive oil, peanut butter)
- Seasonings (e.g. Italian seasoning, chili flakes)
